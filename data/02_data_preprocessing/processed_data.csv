10420150,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome arm 18q is common in sporadic prostate cancer and may be involved in cancer development through inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes (TSG). Recent identification, at 18q21.1, of MADR2/Smad2, a key component in transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-family signaling pathways, led us to investigate the role of this gene in prostate tumorigenesis.
Sporadic primary prostate tumors from 25 patients with clinically localized tumors and 7 with metastatic forms were examined for MADR2/Smad2 mutations by using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis of cDNA, and for gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
We detected no mutation in MADR2/Smad2 and no abnormal mRNA expression.
Despite recent evidence indicating that MADR2/Smad2 acts as a tumor-suppressor gene, our findings suggest a limited role of this gene in prostate tumorigenesis, at least in the early stages. Another key tumor-suppressor gene may therefore be the main target of the observed LOH at 18q21.1.",LOF
10451707,"Recently, three candidate tumor suppressor genes, SMAD2 (MADR2/JV18-1), SMAD4 (DPC4), and DCC, were identified in chromosome band 18q21. We examined allelic imbalance (AI) in 18q21 using six polymorphic microsatellite markers in 38 primary ovarian cancers and four ovarian borderline tumors. AI at one or more loci was detected in 15 of 37 (41%) informative ovarian cancers and in none of the four borderline tumors. Frequent AI was detected at the D18S46 (31%) and D18S474 (36%) loci, which were adjacent to the SMAD4 gene, and at the D18S69 (33%) locus, which was telomeric to the DCC gene. Therefore, we searched for mutations of the SMAD4 gene in 42 primary tumors and eight cell lines by PCR-SSCP and sequencing analyses. Missense mutations were detected in two ovarian tumors and three ovarian cancer cell lines, whereas silent mutation was detected in a primary ovarian cancer. These results suggest that there are at least two tumor suppressor genes on chromosome arm 18q and that SMAD4 is of importance in ovarian tumorigenesis.",LOF
10910046,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 18q predicts poor survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Several putative tumor suppressor genes, such as DCC, DPC4/Smad4, and MADR2/Smad2, are mapped to 18q, but thus far, the important gene locus in HNSCC is not known. To identify possible gene loci on 18q, we performed LOH studies using tumor DNA from 57 HNSCC primary tumor cell lines and DNA isolated from fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells from the same patients. Forty-two highly polymorphic microsatellite markers spaced not more than 5 cM apart (mean distance, 1.82 cM) spanning the region from D18S44 in 18q11.1 to D18S1141 in 18q23 were used. D18S71 in 18p11.21 on 18p was also used to determine whether the short arm was retained. Forty-three of 57 (75%) HNSCC lines showed LOH or isolated allelic imbalance (AI) for at least one locus on 18q. Although many of the cell lines had large distal 18q deletions with a breakpoint between 18q11.1 and 18q12.2 to qter, three loci were identified that were lost in 70% or more of the cases. The minimally lost regions (MLRs) range in size from 1.5-15.79 cM. The most proximal is centered on D18S39 (1.56 cM) in band 18q21.1, with LOH or isolated AI in 28 of 38 (74%) of informative cases. The largest (15.8 cM) begins at D18S61 (28 of 40; 70%) in band 18q22.2 and extends through D18S50 in 18q23. The third is centered on D18S70 (30 of 40; 75%) in band 18q23 (3.67 cM). Of these MLRs, only the one centered on D18S39 has been implicated previously in HNSCC. D18S70, the most frequently lost marker, was the only marker consistently lost in three tumor cell lines with very minimal losses, UM-SCC-19, UM-SCC-67, and UM-SCC-73A. In addition, UM-SCC-91 exhibited AI only at this locus, and UT-SCC-4 had AI at D18S70 and D18S39 only. Close physical mapping of these three regions may pinpoint one or more previously unidentified tumor suppressor genes.",LOF
11172591,"The DPC4 and Madr2 genes are located at 18q21, and the LOH on chromosome 18q21 has been shown to occur frequently in colorectal cancers. To investigate the role of these genes in advanced colorectal cancers, we analyzed 29 colorectal specimens for alterations in the DPC4 and Madr2 genes. Twelve (63.2%) of 19 informative primary colorectal cancers showed allelic loss of chromosome 18q21.3 marker. An alteration of the DPC4 gene sequence was identified in 6 (20.7%) of 29 colorectal carcinomas, and the distinct Madr2 gene mobility shifts were present in 3 (10.3%) cancers. Somatic mutations were identified in these tumors by sequencing analysis. DPC4 gene alterations of 4 cases were detected in Mad homology 2 domains. There was no significant correlation between the somatic alteration of Madr2 and clinicopathological findings. However, the frequency of DPC4 mutation was significantly higher in tumors associated with liver metastasis than in those without such metastasis. Our findings suggest that somatic alteration of the DPC4 gene may play a role in tumorigenesis and liver metastasis of human colorectal cancers.",LOF
11410498,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) regulates cell growth and differentiation, in normal squamous epithelium, via specific TGF-beta receptors and intracellular signaling molecules (Smads). We have previously observed that TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II) expression decreases in squamous cell carcinomas as tumors become less differentiated and more biologically aggressive. However, a small fraction of tumors remain TbetaR-II positive. In this article, we examine the integrity of the other members of the TGF-beta-signaling machinery, the Smad proteins.
Thirteen archived head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were selected from the files of the Pathology Department of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Protein immunoexpression was quantitated by image analysis in the context of histopathological parameters. Mutation analysis of the MADR2/Smad2 gene was also performed.
In both TbetaR-II-positive and TbetaR-II-negative tumors, expression of the non-TGF-beta-specific Smads (4, 6, and 7) was variable, whereas expression of the pathway-specific Smad2 was lost in 38% of the tumors. Expression of the activated, phosphorylated form of this molecule, Smad2-P, was lost in approximately 70% of the tumors. No abnormal mRNA expression and no mutations in the MADR2/Smad2 gene were observed.
These results suggest that multiple defects in TGF-beta signaling, both at the receptor and postreceptor level, may play a role in the oncogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",LOF
20699271,"T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA)-proteins are known regulators of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. In this study, pull-down experiments and mass spectrometry indicate that TIAR/TIAL1 and hnRNP C1/C2 are associated in HeLa nuclear extracts. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull-down assays confirmed this interaction. Interestingly, binding requires the glutamine-rich (Q-rich) C-terminal domain of TIAR and the leucine-rich plus acidic residues-rich C-terminal domains of hnRNP C1/C2. This interaction also occurs in an RNA-dependent manner. Recombinant GFP-TIAR and RFP-hnRNP C1 proteins display partial nuclear co-localization when overexpressed in HeLa cells, and this requires the Q-rich domain of TIAR. hnRNP C1 overexpression in the presence of rate-limiting amounts of TIAR in HeLa and HEK293 cells affects alternative splicing of Fas and FGFR2 minigenes, promoting Fas exon 6 and FGFR2 exon K-SAM skipping, respectively. The repressor activity of hnRNP C1 on Fas exon 6 splicing is mediated by Hu antigen R (HuR). Experiments involving tethering approaches showed that the repressor capacity of hnRNP C1 is associated with an exonic splicing silencer in Fas exon 6. This effect was reversed by splice-site strengthening and is linked to its basic leucine zipper-like motif. These results suggest that hnRNP C1/C2 acts as a bridge between HuR and TIAR to modulate alternative Fas splicing.",GOF
23545898,"Although gastric cancer is increasingly being detected at an early stage of development, diffuse growth‑type malignant tumors, such as scirrhous gastric cancer, are usually at an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis, resulting in poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine whether the K-sam gene and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) expression may be used to identify malignant tumors with a poor prognosis. K-sam and KGF expression was retrospectively evaluated in samples from 86 patients with early and advanced gastric cancer according to type, by examining serum levels and using immunohistochemical staining. The associations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival were also examined. The mean serum KGF levels were 11.191±3.808 pg/ml in early stage and 10.715±3.4991 pg/ml in advanced gastric cancer patients. KGF levels were significantly higher in types 4 and 5 (14.498±3.812 pg/ml, n=6) compared with types 1, 2 and 3 (10.747±3.571 pg/ml, n=80; P=0.028). Stage classification was identified as the only significant factor which determined overall survival. Patients with KGF-positive tumors had significantly higher serum KGF levels compared with those who had KGF-negative tumors. Patients with K-sam‑positive tumors had significantly higher KGF levels compared with those who had K-sam-negative tumors. Pathological KGF expression was not significantly correlated with the degree of differentiation; however, there was a positive correlation between high K-sam expression in scirrhous gastric tumors and serum KGF levels. The present study revealed that high serum KGF levels are a risk factor for diffuse infiltrative gastric cancer and may provide a simple method of identifying patients with a poor prognosis among previously diagnosed preoperative gastric cancer patients.",GOF
28618942,"In the past decades, the oncogenic role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 has been demonstrated in a number of cancer types. However, studies have reported contradictory findings concerning the correlation between fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 expression and prognosis in solid tumors. To address this discrepancy, we performed a meta-analysis with 18 published studies (2975 patients) retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of science. Data were extracted and computed into odds ratios. The results showed that fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 overexpression was significantly associated with decreased 3-year overall survival (odds ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.30-2.85, p = 0.001) and 5-year overall survival (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.44, p = 0.02) in patients with solid tumors. Subgroup analysis revealed that high fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 expression was also associated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and esophageal cancer, but not correlated with pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 overexpression is correlated with decreased survival in most solid tumors, suggesting that the expression status of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 is a valuable prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target in human solid tumors.",GOF
29358956,"MTG16 (myeloid translocation gene on chromosome 16) and its related proteins, MTG8 and MTGR1, define a small family of transcriptional corepressors. These corepressors share highly conserved domain structures yet have distinct biological functions and tissue specificity. In vivo studies have shown that, of the three MTG corepressors, MTG16 is uniquely important for the regulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and differentiation. Apart from this physiological function, MTG16 is also involved in carcinomas and leukemias, acting as the genetic target of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) aberrations in breast cancer and recurrent translocations in leukemia. The frequent involvement of MTG16 in these disease etiologies implies an important developmental role for this transcriptional corepressor. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that MTG16 indirectly alters the disease course of several leukemias via its regulatory interactions with a variety of pathologic fusion proteins. For example, a recent study has shown that MTG16 can repress not only wild-type E2A-mediated transcription, but also leukemia fusion protein E2A-Pbx1-mediated transcription, suggesting that MTG16 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing the E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein. Given that leukemia stem cells share similar regulatory pathways with normal HSPCs, studies to further understand how MTG16 regulates cell proliferation and differentiation could lead to novel therapeutic approaches for leukemia treatment.",GOF

To identify potential biomarkers of MM, serum proteins reflecting alteration in their proteomes were analyzed in 6 patients with MM compared with 6 healthy controls using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry. The most notable differentially expressed proteins were validated by immunoblotting and changes in mRNA expression were evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A total of 11 differentially expressed protein spots were found. The expression levels of 7 proteins [Immunoglobulin heavy constant µ; proto-oncogene diffuse B-cell lymphoma (DBL2); 26S protease regulatory subunit 4 (P26s4); serum albumin; haptoglobin; and two unknown proteins with isoelectronic point (pI) of 6.41 and molecular weight of 35.4 kDa, and pI of 8.05 and molecular weight of 27.4 kDa, respectively] were downregulated in MM compared with healthy controls. Expression of gel actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 1A (ARPC1A); immunoglobulin heavy constant γ 1; fibrinogen α chain (FGA) fragment D; and zinc finger protein 70 were increased in serum of MM patients. Protein expressions of ARPC1A, FGA, P26s4 and DBL2 were measured by immunoblotting in an independent cohort of 12 MM patients and 10 healthy controls. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that ",GOF
30818239,"Environmental pollution occasioned by artisanal activities and technical failures at exploration sites has affected mostly oil producing and other mineral resources mining regions in developed and developing nations. As conventional techniques of remediation seem to be progressively unreliable and inefficient, contaminated land management experts have adopted a plant-based technology described as 'phytoremediation' for effective detoxification and removal of contaminants in substrate environmental media (soil and sediment). This technique, has gained public acceptance because of its aesthetic, eco-friendly, solar energy driven and low cost attributes. With complexity of environmental pollution in Africa, identification of appropriate remediation approach that deliver net environmental benefit and economic profit to the society is vital, while also focusing on the exploitation of plants genetic tools for more clarity on phyto tolerance, uptake and translocation of pollutants. In this article, we reviewed the status, progress and challenges of phytoremediation in selected African countries (South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Egypt and Ghana), the ecological impact of the pollutants, phytoremediation strategies and the possible plants of choice. Besides highlighting the support roles played by soil fauna and flora, the fate of harvested biomass/dieback and its future prospects are also discussed.

Using in utero electroporation to genetically manipulate cortical neurons during corticogenesis, we demonstrate that the mouse Mcf2 gene controls the embryonic migration of cortical projection neurons. Strikingly, we find that the CBPS-associated MCF2 mutation impairs cortical laminar positioning, supporting the hypothesis that alterations in the process of embryonic neuronal migration can lead to rare cases of CBPS.",GOF
32004476,"Continual efferocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by macrophages prevents necrosis and promotes injury resolution. How continual efferocytosis is promoted is not clear. Here, we show that the process is optimized by linking the metabolism of engulfed cargo from initial efferocytic events to subsequent rounds. We found that continual efferocytosis is enhanced by the metabolism of AC-derived arginine and ornithine to putrescine by macrophage arginase 1 (Arg1) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Putrescine augments HuR-mediated stabilization of the mRNA encoding the GTP-exchange factor Dbl, which activates actin-regulating Rac1 to facilitate subsequent rounds of AC internalization. Inhibition of any step along this pathway after first-AC uptake suppresses second-AC internalization, whereas putrescine addition rescues this defect. Mice lacking myeloid Arg1 or ODC have defects in efferocytosis in vivo and in atherosclerosis regression, while treatment with putrescine promotes atherosclerosis resolution. Thus, macrophage metabolism of AC-derived metabolites allows for optimal continual efferocytosis and resolution of injury.",GOF
32553763,"Notch signaling maintains intestinal stem cells (ISCs). When ISCs exit the niche, Notch signaling among early progenitor cells at position +4/5 regulates their specification toward secretory vs enterocyte lineages (binary fate). The transcription factor ATOH1 is repressed by Notch in ISCs; its de-repression, when Notch is inactivated, drives progenitor cells to differentiate along the secretory lineage. However, it is not clear what promotes transition of ISCs to progenitors and how this fate decision is established.
We sorted cells from Lgr5-GFP knockin intestines from mice and characterized gene expression patterns. We analyzed Notch regulation by examining expression profiles (by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNAscope) of small intestinal organoids incubated with the Notch inhibitor DAPT, intestine tissues from mice given injections of the γ-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine, and mice with intestine-specific disruption of Rbpj. We analyzed intestine tissues from mice with disruption of the RUNX1 translocation partner 1 gene (Runx1t1, also called Mtg8) or CBFA2/RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 3 (Cbfa2t3, also called Mtg16), and derived their organoids, by histology, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analyses of intestinal crypts to identify genes regulated by MTG16.
The transcription co-repressors MTG8 and MTG16 were highly expressed by +4/5 early progenitors, compared with other cells along crypt-villus axis. Expression of MTG8 and MTG16 were repressed by Notch signaling via ATOH1 in organoids and intestine tissues from mice. MTG8- and MTG16-knockout intestines had increased crypt hyperproliferation and expansion of ISCs, but enterocyte differentiation was impaired, based on loss of enterocyte markers and functions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analyses showed that MTG16 bound to promoters of genes that are specifically expressed by stem cells (such as Lgr5 and Ascl2) and repressed their transcription. MTG16 also bound to previously reported enhancer regions of genes regulated by ATOH1, including genes that encode Delta-like canonical Notch ligand and other secretory-specific transcription factors.
In intestine tissues of mice and human intestinal organoids, MTG8 and MTG16 repress transcription in the earliest progenitor cells to promote exit of ISCs from their niche (niche exit) and control the binary fate decision (secretory vs enterocyte lineage) by repressing genes regulated by ATOH1.",GOF

33405429,"DPC4 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is usually part of the work-up of mucinous neoplasms in the ovary where the distinction between an ovarian primary and metastatic pancreaticobiliary adenocarcinoma (PanACa) must be made. Although DPC4 IHC is lost in about 55% (46%-61%) of PanACas and typically retained in most primary ovarian mucinous neoplasms, no study has evaluated the expression of this marker in a large cohort of neoplasms arising in or involving gynecologic (GYN) organs. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the expression of DPC4 IHC in a total of 251 tumors and lesions related to the GYN tract in which DPC4 IHC stain was performed during the initial pathology evaluation. Of these, 138 were primary GYN tumors and lesions, 31 were metastatic GYN tumors involving non-GYN sites, and 83 were metastatic non-GYN tumors involving the GYN tract. We identified 27 cases with loss of DPC4 IHC expression of which 20 cases met the inclusion criteria (i.e. clinical information was available to determine the site of tumor origin). We observed that loss of DPC4 nuclear expression was most commonly seen in tumors of endocervical origin (n=7), of which 5 were gastric-type cervical adenocarcinomas (GCxACa) and 2 were usual-type cervical adenocarcinomas, either primary or metastatic. This was followed by tumors of the pancreaticobiliary tract (n=5), ovary (n=2), and appendix (n=1). In addition, 1 gastric-type vaginal adenocarcinoma (GVaACa) also showed loss of DPC4.

33574569,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with a minimal difference between its incidence rate and mortality rate. Advances in oncology over the past several decades have dramatically improved the overall survival of patients with multiple cancers due to the implementation of new techniques in early diagnosis, therapeutic drugs, and personalized therapy. However, pancreatic cancers remain recalcitrant, with a 5-year relative survival rate of <9%. The lack of measures for early diagnosis, strong resistance to chemotherapy, ineffective adjuvant chemotherapy and the unavailability of molecularly targeted therapy are responsible for the high mortality rate of this notorious disease. Genetically, PDAC progresses as a complex result of the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors. Although next-generation sequencing has identified numerous new genetic alterations, their clinical implications remain unknown. Classically, oncogenic mutations in genes such as KRAS and loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors, such as TP53, CDNK2A, DPC4/SMAD4, and BRCA2, are frequently observed in PDAC. Currently, research on these key driver genes is still the main focus. Therefore, studies assessing the functions of these genes and their potential clinical implications are of paramount importance.

Subsequently, explorations and validations of the biological function and the immune-related and sunitinib-related characteristics were conducted in KEGG, TISIDB, Oncomine, ICGC, and GEO databases.
We refined immature dendritic cells and central memory CD4 T cells which showed associations with sunitinib and ccRCC. Following, five hub genes (CRYBB1, RIMBP3C, CEACAM4, HAMP, and LYL1) were identified for their strong relationships with sunitinib and immune infiltration in ccRCC. Further validations in external data refined CRYBB1, CEACAM4, and HAMP which play a vital role in sunitinib resistance, immune infiltrations in ccRCC, and the development and progression of ccRCC. In conclusion, our findings could shed light on the resistance of sunitinib in ccRCC and provide novel biomarkers or drug targets for ccRCC.",GOF
34406628,"Colorectal cancer is the main cause of human death due to cancer. This fact could be due to the insufficiency of early diagnosis or poor therapeutic strategies. Various molecular tools have been utilized in studies to assess their potentials as diagnostic biomarkers or determining factors in precision medicine. Among these molecules, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been emerging as accurate and potent transcripts to improve the detection of cancer. The overexpressed lncRNAs could also be deeply studied as the molecules for the targeted therapy in different malignancies, in particular colorectal cancer. Thus, we utilized an unbiased approach to select the up-regulated lncRNAs in colon adenocarcinoma via analyzing the TCGA dataset. Then, we validated the overexpression of two first-ranked lncRNAs, i.e., NPSR1-AS1 and TLX1NB, in our in-house colorectal cancer samples as compared to the paired adjacent normal tissues. The analyses revealed that these lncRNAs could significantly distinguish the tumor against the normal samples. The results may have implications in the early diagnosis and targeted therapy of colorectal cancer.",GOF

MiR-425-5p was reported to function in various tumors. However, the roles and underlying mechanism of miR-425-5p involvement in OC development and progression are unclear.
A comprehensive strategy of data mining, computational biology, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to identify the involvement of miR-425-5p in OC progression. The effect of miR-425-5p on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8, wound-healing, and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Luciferase assay was performed to evaluate the interactions between miR-425-5p and MAGI2-AS3 or AFF4.
miR-425-5p was significantly up-regulated in OC tissues and cells. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-425-5p was negatively regulated by MAGI2-AS3. Silencing miR-425-5p inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that AFF4 was the target gene of miR-425-5p. Moreover, AFF4 expression was significantly decreased in OC and was closely related to the good prognosis of patients with OC. AFF4 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells in vitro. By contrast, silencing AFF4 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells in vitro. Finally, AFF4 suppression rescued the inhibitory effect of silencing miR-425-5p on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells.
To the best our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that miR-425-5p overexpression in OC is negatively regulated by MAGI2-AS3. Moreover, miR-425-5p promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC cells by targeting AFF4, suggesting that miR-425-5p/AFF4 signaling pathway represented a novel therapeutic target for patients with OC.",GOF

34853447,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) is described as a main regulator of cell survival and apoptosis in multiple types of cells, including hepatocytes. Dysregulation in TNF-induced apoptosis is associated with many autoimmune diseases and various liver diseases. Here, we demonstrated a crucial role of Bcl-3, an IκB family member, in regulating TNF-induced hepatic cell death. Specifically, we found that the presence of Bcl-3 promoted TNF-induced cell death in the liver, while Bcl-3 deficiency protected mice against TNF/D-GalN induced hepatoxicity and lethality. Consistently, Bcl-3-depleted hepatic cells exhibited decreased sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis when stimulated with TNF/CHX. Mechanistically, the in vitro results showed that Bcl-3 interacted with the deubiquitinase CYLD to synergistically switch the ubiquitination status of RIP1 and facilitate the formation of death-inducing Complex II. This complex further resulted in activation of the caspase cascade to induce apoptosis. By revealing this novel role of Bcl-3 in regulating TNF-induced hepatic cell death, this study provides a potential therapeutic target for liver diseases caused by TNF-related apoptosis.",GOF
34887504,"During ontogeny, macrophage populations emerge in the Yolk Sac (YS) via two distinct progenitor waves, prior to hematopoietic stem cell development. Macrophage progenitors from the primitive/""early EMP"" and transient-definitive/""late EMP"" waves both contribute to various resident primitive macrophage populations in the developing embryonic organs. Identifying factors that modulates early stages of macrophage progenitor development may lead to a better understanding of defective function of specific resident macrophage subsets. Here we show that YS primitive macrophage progenitors express Lyl-1, a bHLH transcription factor related to SCL/Tal-1. Transcriptomic analysis of YS macrophage progenitors indicate that primitive macrophage progenitors present at embryonic day 9 are clearly distinct from those present at later stages. Disruption of Lyl-1 basic helix-loop-helix domain leads initially to an increased emergence of primitive macrophage progenitors, and later to their defective differentiation. These defects are associated with a disrupted expression of gene sets related to embryonic patterning and neurodevelopment. Lyl-1-deficiency also induce a reduced production of mature macrophages/microglia in the early brain, as well as a transient reduction of the microglia pool at midgestation and in the newborn. We thus identify Lyl-1 as a critical regulator of primitive macrophages and microglia development, which disruption may impair resident-macrophage function during organogenesis.",GOF

However, its roles in predicting the tumorigenesis and prognosis have not been identified in LUSC. To identify the roles of RBPs in the tumorigenesis and prognosis of LUSC, the RNA sequencing data of patients with LUSC were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. The differential expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated and identified. The intersection of manually curated RBPs and tumorigenesis-related DEGs was filtered to the univariate Cox regression analysis. The intersection genes with prognostic value were defined as prognostic RNA-binding protein genes (PRBPGs). Based on them, the predicted model was constructed. Its accuracy was tested by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve and the risk score. In addition, to explore the key regulatory network, the relationship among PRBPGs, target RNA, and absolute quantification of 50 hallmarks of cancer was also identified by Pearson correlation analysis. A total of 311 genes were filtered as the intersection of 1542 manually curated RBPs and tumorigenesis-related DEGs and the results revealed 17 PRBPGs.

34935961,"P-TEFb modulates RNA polymerase II elongation through alternative interaction with negative and positive regulation factors. While inactive P-TEFbs are mainly sequestered in the 7SK snRNP complex in a chromatin-free state, most of its active forms are in complex with its recruitment factors, Brd4 and SEC, in a chromatin-associated state. Thus, switching from inactive 7SK snRNP to active P-TEFb (Brd4/P-TEFb or SEC/P-TEFb) is essential for global gene expression. Although it has been shown that cellular signaling stimulates the disruption of 7SK snRNP, releasing dephosphorylated and catalytically inactive P-TEFb, little is known about how the inactive released P-TEFb is reactivated. Here, we show that the Cdk9/CycT1 heterodimer released from 7SK snRNP is completely dissociated into monomers in response to stress. Brd4 or SEC then recruits monomerized Cdk9 and CycT1 to reassemble the core P-TEFb. Meanwhile, the binding of monomeric dephosphorylated Cdk9 to either Brd4 or SEC induces the autophosphorylation of T186 of Cdk9. Finally, the same mechanism is employed during nocodazole released entry into early G1 phase of cell cycle. Therefore, our studies demonstrate a novel mechanism by which Cdk9 and CycT1 monomers are reassembled on chromatin to form active P-TEFb by its interaction with Brd4 or SEC to regulate transcription.",GOF

However, the mechanism through which LOS enhances ACE2 expression remains unclear. In addition, the response of ACE2 to LOS differs among patients. Our LOS-treated patient data revealed a correlated mechanism of ACE2 with components of the renin-angiotensinogen system. We observed a significant positive regulation of MAS1 and ACE2 expression.

The patient had a karyotype of 46,XX. AZF analysis showed that he missed the AZF region (including a, b and c) and SRY gene. STR assay revealed he possessed the AMELX in the X chromosome, but he had no the AMELY and SRY in the Y chromosome. FISH analysis with CSP X/CSP Y/SRY showed only two X centromeric signals, but none Y chromosome and SRY. The above results of the karyotype, FISH and STR analysis did not suggest a Y chromosome chimerism existed in the patient's peripheral blood. The result of the CMA indicated a heterozygous deletion with an approximate size of 867 kb in Xq27.1 (hg19: chrX: 138,612,879-139,480,163 bp), located at 104 kb downstream of SOX3 gene, including F9, CXorf66, MCF2 and ATP11C.

An important family of transcription factors that regulate the body's response is the FOX family which plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. The members of this family include the intracellular protein Foxp3, which regulates the process of differentiation of the T lymphocyte subpopulation, and more precisely, is responsible for the development of regulatory T lymphocytes. This protein influences several cellular processes both directly and indirectly. In the process of cytokine production regulation, the Foxp3 protein interacts with numerous proteins and transcription factors such as NFAT, nuclear factor kappa B, and Runx1/AML1 and is involved in the process of histone acetylation in condensed chromatin. Malfunctioning of transcription factor Foxp3 caused by the mutagenesis process affects the development of disorders of the immune response and autoimmune diseases. This applies to the impairment or inability of the immune system to fight infections due to a disruption of the mechanisms supporting immune homeostasis which in turn leads to the development of a special group of disorders called primary immunodeficiencies (PID).

To date, TIAM1 has not been associated with a Mendelian disorder. Here, we describe five individuals with bi-allelic TIAM1 missense variants who have developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech delay, and seizures. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that these variants are rare and likely pathogenic. We found that the Drosophila ortholog of TIAM1, still life (sif), is expressed in larval and adult central nervous system (CNS) and is mainly expressed in a subset of neurons, but not in glia. Loss of sif reduces the survival rate, and the surviving adults exhibit climbing defects, are prone to severe seizures, and have a short lifespan. The TIAM1 reference (Ref) cDNA partially rescues the sif loss-of-function (LoF) phenotypes. We also assessed the function associated with three TIAM1 variants carried by two of the probands and compared them to the TIAM1 Ref cDNA function in vivo. TIAM1 p.Arg23Cys has reduced rescue ability when compared to TIAM1 Ref, suggesting that it is a partial LoF variant. In ectopic expression studies, both wild-type sif and TIAM1 Ref are toxic, whereas the three variants (p.Leu862Phe, p.Arg23Cys, and p.Gly328Val) show reduced toxicity, suggesting that they are partial LoF variants.

Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining revealed that the overexpression of MAS1 notably attenuated MI-related myocardium injury in the MI rat model. Echocardiography analysis revealed that MI inhibited left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS), whereas the MAS1 overexpression could increase LVEF and LVFS in the MI rats. Meanwhile, the expression of collagen I, collagen III, α-SMA, ANP, and BNP was decreased by MAS1 overexpression in the MI rats. MAS1 attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, the overexpression of MAS1 decreased the expression of PTEN and enhanced the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in vivo and in vitro. The overexpression of PTEN and the PI3k inhibitor LY294002 could reverse the MAS1-mediated MI injury.

The pathogenicity of the variants was thereafter investigated by bioinformatics analysis.
A total of 50 patients (57.20 ± 15.52 years, male/female: 1.63: 1) with PDB were included and the mean onset age was 48.34 years (48.34 ± 17.24 years). 94.0% of the patients exhibited symptomatic patterns described as bone pain (86.0%), elevated skin temperature at the lesion site (26.0%), bone deformity (22.0%) and local swelling (18.0%).

Here we attempted to better understand the disease at the molecular level based on the transcriptomic landscape of 707 T-ALL patients (510 pediatric, 190 adult patients, and 7 with unknown age; 599 from published cohorts and 108 newly investigated). Leveraging the information of gene expression enabled us to identify 10 subtypes (G1–G10), including the previously undescribed one characterized by GATA3 mutations, with GATA3R276Q capable of affecting lymphocyte development in zebrafish. Through associating with T cell differentiation stages, we found that high expression of LYL1/LMO2/SPI1/HOXA (G1–G6) might represent the early T cell progenitor, pro/precortical/cortical stage with a relatively high age of disease onset, and lymphoblasts with TLX3/TLX1 high expression (G7–G8) could be blocked at the cortical/postcortical stage, while those with high expression of NKX2-1/TAL1/LMO1 (G9–G10) might correspond to cortical/postcortical/mature stages of T cell development. Notably, adult patients harbored more cooperative mutations among epigenetic regulators, and genes involved in JAK-STAT and RAS signaling pathways, with 44% of patients aged 40 y or above in G1 bearing DNMT3A/IDH2 mutations usually seen in acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting the nature of mixed phenotype acute leukemia.",GOF

In this pre-specified analysis of the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED study, we compared changes in blood pressure, antihypertensive drug use, and safety up to 36 months in renal denervation versus a sham control group.
This randomised, single-blind, sham-controlled trial enrolled patients from 25 clinical centres in the USA, Germany, Japan, the UK, Australia, Austria, and Greece, with uncontrolled hypertension and office systolic blood pressure between 150 mm Hg and 180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Eligible patients had to have 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure between 140 mm Hg and less than 170 mm Hg, while taking one to three antihypertensive drugs with stable doses for at least 6 weeks. Patients underwent renal angiography and were randomly assigned (1:1) to radiofrequency renal denervation or a sham control procedure. Patients and physicians were unmasked after 12-month follow-up and sham control patients could cross over after 12-month follow-up completion. The primary endpoint was the treatment difference in mean 24-h systolic blood pressure at 6 months between the renal denervation group and the sham control group. Statistical analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. Long-term efficacy was assessed using ambulatory and office blood pressure measurements up to 36 months. Drug surveillance was used to assess medication use. Safety events were assessed up to 36 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02439775; prospectively, an additional 260 patients are currently being randomly assigned as part of the SPYRAL HTN-ON MED Expansion trial.
Between July 22, 2015, and June 14, 2017, among 467 enrolled patients, 80 patients fulfilled the qualifying criteria and were randomly assigned to undergo renal denervation (n=38) or a sham control procedure (n=42). Mean ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced from baseline in the renal denervation group, and were significantly lower than the sham control group at 24 and 36 months, despite a similar treatment intensity of antihypertensive drugs. The medication burden at 36 months was 2·13 medications (SD 1·15) in the renal denervation group and 2·55 medications (2·19) in the sham control group (p=0·26). 24 (77%) of 31 patients in the renal denervation group and 25 (93%) of 27 patients in the sham control group adhered to medication at 36 months. At 36 months, the ambulatory systolic blood pressure reduction was -18·7 mm Hg (SD 12·4) for the renal denervation group (n=30) and -8·6 mm Hg (14·6) for the sham control group (n=32; adjusted treatment difference -10·0 mm Hg, 95% CI -16·6 to -3·3; p=0·0039). Treatment differences between the renal denervation group and sham control group at 36 months were -5·9 mm Hg (95% CI -10·1 to -1·8; p=0·0055) for mean ambulatory diastolic blood pressure, -11·0 mm Hg (-19·8 to -2·1; p=0·016) for morning systolic blood pressure, and -11·8 mm Hg (-19·0 to -4·7; p=0·0017) for night-time systolic blood pressure. There were no short-term or long-term safety issues associated with renal denervation.
Radiofrequency renal denervation compared with sham control produced a clinically meaningful and lasting blood pressure reduction up to 36 months of follow-up, independent of concomitant antihypertensive medications and without major safety events. Renal denervation could provide an adjunctive treatment modality in the management of patients with hypertension.

Children with newly diagnosed ALL between October 2016 and July 2021 from 18 hospitals participating in the South China children's leukemia Group (SCCLG) were recruited and randomly classified into two subsets in a 7:3 ratio (training set, n=1187; validation set, n=506). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis were adopted to screen independent prognostic factors. Then, a nomogram can be build based on these prognostic factors to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year EFS. Concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance and clinical utility of nomogram.
The parameters that predicted EFS were age at diagnosis, white blood cell at diagnosis, immunophenotype, ETV6-RUNX1/TEL-AML1 gene fusion, bone marrow remission at day 15, and minimal residual disease at day 15. The nomogram incorporated the six factors and provided C-index values of 0.811 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.792-0.830] and 0.797 (95% CI = 0.769-0.825) in the training and validation set, respectively. The calibration curve and AUC revealed that the nomogram had good ability to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year EFS. DCA also indicated that our nomogram had good clinical utility.

PIM1 is a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular functions, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcriptional activation via the phosphorylation of many target proteins, including MYC. PIM1 is overexpressed in several cancers and has been associated with the treatment-resistance. We investigated the expression and function of PIM1 in EMC, particularly SC. Immunohistochemical analysis in 133 EMC cases [103 endometrioid carcinomas (EC) and 30 SC] revealed the significantly stronger expression of PIM1 in SC than in EC and significantly shorter survival of patients with the overexpression of PIM1 in all EMC cases, as well as in only SC cases. A multivariate analysis identified the overexpression of PIM1 as an independent prognostic factor. The knockdown of PIM1 by siRNA in the SC cell line, ARK1, decreased the expression of phosphorylated MYC and reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion. The PIM1 inhibitor, SGI-1776, reduced cell viability in SC cell lines (ARK1, ARK2, and SPAC1L) with IC50 between 1 and 5 µM. SGI-1776 also reduced the migration and invasion of ARK1 cells. Moreover, the oral administration of SGI-1776 significantly suppressed subcutaneous ARK1 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice without impairing health.

Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified a TCF3-DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1) axis which was differentially expressed and interacted in gliomas. More specifically, TCF3 activated DNMT1 transcription, and DNMT1 repressed SFRP1 expression. TCF3 and DNMT1 were overexpressed, while SFRP1 was downregulated in glioma. Functionally, TCF3 silencing inhibited cell proliferation and migration, and promoted apoptosis, which were reversed by DNMT1. SFRP1 inhibited the tumor supporting effects of DNMT1 on glioma cells. Moreover, TCF3 downregulation or SFRP1 overexpression inhibited tumorigenesis and enhanced apoptosis of glioma cells, while DNMT1 enhanced tumorigenesis and repressed apoptosis in tumor tissues in vivo. The Wnt pathway was a downstream effector of the TCF3-DNMT1-SFRP1 axis.

NLRP3 plays a key role in the formation of CIS‑associated inflammasome. Understanding how NLRP3 is regulated bears great importance. We hypothesized that lncRNA NEAT1 can downregulate NLRP3 expression by regulating the miR‑10b‑5p/BCL6 axis, and thus regulate microglia‑driven inflammation. The expression of NEAT1 was analyzed in CIS patients and an in vitro model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/re‑oxygenation (OGD/R). We assessed the levels of pro‑inflammatory cytokines IL‑18 and IL‑1β with ELISA. Interactions between NEAT1/miR‑10b‑5p and miR‑10b‑5p/BCL6 were determined by luciferase assay. The interaction of BCL6 and NLRP3 was identified by ChIP; RNA, and protein levels were evaluated by qRT‑PCR and western blot, respectively. We found that NEAT1 level was decreased in CIS patients and OGD/R treated cells. OGD/R exerted pro‑inflammasome effects by increasing the expression of inflammasome‑associated proteins and ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) while inhibiting SOD production. This effect was partially antagonized by NEAT1. We bioinformatically identified interactions between NEAT1/miR‑10b‑5p, BCL6/miR‑10b‑5p, and NLRP3‑promoter/BCL6, and validated them by luciferase assay, qRT‑PCR, and ChIP. NEAT1 inhibited miR‑10b‑5p and upregulated BCL6 by ceRNA mechanism and alleviated OGD/R induced cell damage. We also proved that BCL6 was a repressive transcription factor in the regulation of NLRP3 expression. Thus, lncRNA NEAT1 inhibited inflammasome activation by NLRP3 in microglia via the NEAT1/ miR‑10b‑5p/BCL6/NLRP3 regulatory axis, which alleviated deleterious outcomes of ischemic stroke.",GOF

This paper aimed to explore whether PBX1 could be involved in the development of PD. The construction of the in vitro PD model was followed by the determination of PBX1 expression. Then, PBX1 was overexpressed to observe the changes in the cell viability, TH expression, oxidative stress and apoptosis of the model. The mitochondrial membrane potential analysis and detection of PINK1/parkin expression were also conducted. To observe whether FOXA1 was involved in the mechanism, its expression was measured, and its association with PBX1 was determined. Subsequently, FOXA1 was silenced to observe whether PBX1 did effects on dopaminergic neuron via FOXA1. PBX1 attenuates 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuronal cell injury and oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Its overexpression ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons and upregulates the expression of PINK1/parkin. PBX1 could combine with FOXA1 and affects 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuronal damage and regulates PINK1/PARKIN expression via FOXA1.

The clinical manifestations and adverse events of the 2 drugs were also investigated. RESULTS Compared with patients with HCC treated with sorafenib, patients treated with lenvatinib developed 8 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, FGF4, FGF23, UNC13C, RIMBP2, STXBP5L, PHOX2B, NEUROD4, and POU4F2) and 3 miRNAs (DEMs, has-miR-548ah, has-miR-888, and has-miR-196a-1), of which hsa-miR-548 regulated 4 target genes, the largest number among the 3 miRNAs. The functions of these DEMs and DEGs were verified by external experiments in the HCC cell line Hep3B2.1-7. We further investigated the adverse events of the drugs for patients with advanced HCC in clinical treatment. The patients in the sorafenib group developed less frequent symptoms of hypertension and diarrhea. Also, the frequency of hand-foot skin reactions in patients treated with lenvatinib was lower than that of patients treated with sorafenib (P<0.05).

We performed our original whole‑genomic RNA‑Seq data to analyze the global transcription and alternative splicing profiles in a human GC cell line by comparing DEK siRNA‑treated and control conditions, dissecting both differential gene expression and potential alternative splicing events regulated by DEK. The siRNA‑mediated knockdown of DEK in a GC cell line led to significant changes in gene expression of multiple cancer‑related genes including both oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Moreover, it was revealed that DEK regulated a number of alternative splicing in genes which were significantly enriched in various cancer‑related pathways including apoptosis and cell cycle processes. This study clarified for the first time that DEK has a regulatory effect on the alternative splicing, as well as on the expression, of numerous cancer‑related genes, which is consistent with the role of DEK as a possible oncogene.

To further understand the role of imprinted genes during the porcine skeletal muscle growth, DNA-seq and RNA-seq were used to explore the characteristics of imprinted genes from porcine reciprocal crosses. A total of 584 545 single-nucleotide variations were discovered in the DNA-seq data of F0 parents, heterozygous in two pig breeds (Yorkshire and Min pigs) but homozygous in each breed. These single-nucleotide variations were used to determine the allelic-specific expression in F1 individuals. Finally, eight paternal expression sites and three maternal expression sites were detected, whereas two paternally expressed imprinted genes (NDN and IGF2) and one maternally expressed imprinted gene (H1-3) were validated by Sanger sequencing. DNA methylation regulates the expression of imprinted genes, and all of the identified imprinted genes in this study were predicted to possess CpG islands. PBX1 and YY1 binding motifs were discovered in the promoter regions of all three imprinted genes, which were candidate elements regulating the transcription of imprinted genes. For these identified imprinted genes, IGF2 and NDN promoted muscle growth whereas H1-3 inhibited cell proliferation, corroborating the 'parental conflict' theory that paternally expressed imprinted genes assisted descendants' growth whereas maternally expressed imprinted genes inhibited it.

35483548,"Mammalian genomes encode over a hundred different helicases, many of which are implicated in the repair of DNA lesions by acting on DNA structures arising during DNA replication, recombination or transcription. Defining the in vivo substrates of such DNA helicases is a major challenge given the large number of helicases in the genome, the breadth of potential substrates in the genome and the degree of genetic pleiotropy among DNA helicases in resolving diverse substrates. Helicases such as WRN, BLM and RECQL5 are implicated in the resolution of error-free recombination events known as sister chromatid exchange events (SCEs). Single cell Strand-seq can be used to map the genomic location of individual SCEs at a resolution that exceeds that of classical cytogenetic techniques by several orders of magnitude. By mapping the genomic locations of SCEs in the absence of different helicases, it should in principle be possible to infer the substrate specificity of specific helicases. Here we describe how the genome can be interrogated for such DNA repair events using single-cell template strand sequencing (Strand-seq) and bioinformatic tools. SCEs and copy-number alterations were mapped to genomic locations at kilobase resolution in haploid KBM7 cells.

IR could decrease the miR-486-3p levels in vitro and in vivo, and that effect was closely correlated to the occurrence of RIPF.

In addition, the molecular mechanism underlying the IR-induced miRNA level reduction was explored. The increased in BCL6 could inhibit the formation of pri-miR-486-3p, thereby reducing the levels of miR-486-3p in the alveolar epithelial cells, which would otherwise promote EMT and contribute to RIPF by targeting Snail.

We identified a total of 20 CNVs using whole exome sequencing data of a cohort of 191 patients with a suspected IEI. A definite molecular diagnosis could be made in five patients (2.6%), including pathogenic deletions affecting ICOS, TNFAIP3, and 22q11.2. CNVs of uncertain significance were observed in fifteen patients (7.9%), including deletions of 11q22.1q22.3 and 16p11.2 but also duplications affecting entire or parts of genes previously associated with IEI. Importantly, five patients carrying a CNV of uncertain significance also carried pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNVs (PIK3R1, NFKB1, NLRC4, DOCK2), or SNVs of unknown significance (NFKB2). This cooccurrence of SNVs and CNVs suggests modifying effects in some patients, and functional follow-up is warranted now in order to better understand phenotypic heterogeneity. In summary, the diagnostic yield of IEI can be increased substantially by evaluating CNVs, which allows an improved therapeutic management in those patients.",GOF

Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) accounts for the majority of these cases and is frequently associated with a variety of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. The aim of the present study was to explore the clinical characteristics, treatments and prognosis of patients with t-AML. A total of 272 cases of AML treated at our institution between 2016 and 2020 were reviewed, among which nine cases of t-AML were identified for analysis. All patients had received alkylating or topoisomerase II inhibitor chemotherapy drugs for primary cancer treatment and three patients had received radiotherapy. A total of nine patients had been administered recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The median latency period for the nine patients with t-AML was 25 months (range, 10-240 months). The molecular cytogenetic abnormalities included t(15:17)(q22:q21), inv(16)(p13q22), del(5)(q22), CBFB/MYH11(+), FLT3(+), NARS(+), IDH(+), TET2(+), and TP53(+).

35508511,"The transcription factor complex, consisting of LMO2, TAL1 or LYL1, and GATA2, plays an important role in capillary sprouting by regulating VEGFR2, DLL4, and angiopoietin 2 in tip cells. Overexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor LYL1 in transgenic mice results in shortened tails. This phenotype is associated with vessel hyperbranching and a relative paucity of straight vessels due to DLL4 downregulation in tip cells by forming aberrant complex consisting of LMO2 and LYL1. Knockdown of LMO2 or TAL1 inhibits capillary sprouting in spheroid-based angiogenesis assays, which is associated with decreased angiopoietin 2 secretion. In the same assay using mixed TAL1- and LYL1-expressing endothelial cells, TAL1 was found to be primarily located in tip cells, while LYL1-expressing cells tended to occupy the stalk position in sprouts by upregulating VEGFR1 than TAL1. Thus, the interaction between LMO2 and TAL1 in tip cells plays a key role in angiogenic switch of sprouting angiogenesis.",GOF

However, the molecular determinants involved in cardiac inflammation and cardiomyocyte necrosis remain poorly characterized, and cardioprotective molecules are currently missing. Here, we applied an in vivo method based on the functional selection (FunSel) of cardioprotective factors using AAV vectors for the unbiased identification of novel immunomodulatory molecules in a Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis mouse model. Two consecutive rounds of in vivo FunSel using an expression library of 60 cytokines were sufficient to identify five cardioprotective factors (IL9, IL3, IL4, IL13, IL15). The screening also revealed three cytokines (IL18, IL17b, and CCL11) that were counter-selected and likely to exert a detrimental effect. The pooled overexpression of the five most enriched cytokines using AAV9 vectors decreased inflammation and reduced cardiac dilatation, persisting at 1 month after treatment. Individual overexpression of IL9, the top ranking in our functional selection, markedly reduced cardiac inflammation and injury, concomitant with an increase of anti-inflammatory Th2-cells and a reduction of pro-inflammatory Th17- and Th22-cells at 14 days post-infection.

Here, we reported the Tiam1 high expression and prognostic significance in BC. In vitro and in vivo experimental assays identified the functional role of Tiam1 in promoting BC cells proliferation, metastasis and glycolysis reprogramming. Mechanistically, we showed for the first time that Tiam1 could interact with the crucial glycolytic enzyme PFKL and promoted evolution of BC in an PFKL-dependent manner. Moreover, miR-21-5p was found to exacerbate the BC proliferative and aggressive by targeting Tiam1.

35522713,"Over the years it has been established that SIN1, a key component of mTORC2, could interact with Ras family small GTPases through its Ras-binding domain (RBD). The physical association of Ras and SIN1/mTORC2 could potentially affect both mTORC2 and Ras-ERK pathways. To decipher the precise molecular mechanism of this interaction, we determined the high-resolution structures of HRas/KRas-SIN1 RBD complexes, showing the detailed interaction interface. Mutation of critical interface residues abolished Ras-SIN1 interaction and in SIN1 knockout cells we demonstrated that Ras-SIN1 association promotes SGK1 activity but inhibits insulin-induced ERK activation. With structural comparison and competition fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays we showed that HRas-SIN1 RBD association is much weaker than HRas-Raf1 RBD but is slightly stronger than HRas-PI3K RBD interaction, providing a possible explanation for the different outcome of insulin or EGF stimulation. We also found that SIN1 isoform lacking the PH domain binds stronger to Ras than other longer isoforms and the PH domain appears to have an inhibitory effect on Ras-SIN1 binding. In addition, we uncovered a Ras dimerization interface that could be critical for Ras oligomerization.

Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify optimal prognostic lncRNAs. MTS, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays were used to determine the effects of LINC00278 overexpression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. The expressions of signaling pathway-related proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins were detected using western blot. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to demonstrate the binding of ETS proto-oncogene 1, transcription factor (ETS1), and LINC00278 promoter region. The molecular targets of LINC00278 were identified by RNA sequencing analysis and co-expression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis and CIBERSORT algorithm were used to analyze survival and immune cell infiltration based on LINC00278, COL4A1, and COL4A2. Multivariate Cox regression was used to establish a six-gene prognostic model. LINC00278 expression was low in LSCC tissues, and it was significantly associated with the TNM (tumors/nodes/metastases) stage (p < 0.001), lymphatic metastasis (p < 0.01), and pathological differentiation (p < 0.01). LINC00278 overexpression significantly reduced LSCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in TU686, TU177, and AMC-HN-8 cell lines. E-cadherin protein expression was increased, while N-cadherin, Vimentin, Zeb1, and Snail protein expression was decreased in the LINC00278 group, compared to the pcDNA3.1 group. Additionally, in AMC-HN-8 and FaDu cell lines, the LINC00278-treated group had significantly lower p-AKT and p-mTOR protein levels than the control group. ETS1 is a direct transcriptional regulator of the LINC00278 gene based on luciferase reporter assays and ChIP experiments. Western blot analysis demonstrated that high LINC00278 expression inhibited both ETS1 expression and phosphorylation. COL4A1/COL4A2 were identified as potential downstream targets of LINC00278. Meanwhile, the LINC00278/COL4A1/COL4A2-dominated low-risk group showed higher antigen-presenting activity and a higher immune score than the high-risk group. The findings indicated that ETS1 upregulated LINC00278 expression on the Y chromosome, which in turn inhibited LSCC growth in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via downregulation of COL4A1/COL4A2.",GOF

35536646,"Rearrangements that drive ectopic MEF2C expression have recurrently been found in human early thymocyte progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) patients. Here we show high levels of MEF2C expression in ETP-ALL patients. Using both in vivo and in vitro models of ETP-ALL, we demonstrate that elevated MEF2C expression blocks NOTCH-induced T cell differentiation while promoting a B-lineage program. MEF2C activates a B cell transcriptional program in addition to RUNX1, GATA3 and LMO2, upregulates the IL7R and boosts cell survival by upregulation of BCL2. MEF2C and the Notch pathway therefore demarcate opposite regulators of B- or T-lineage choices, respectively. Enforced MEF2C expression in mouse or human progenitor cells effectively blocks early T cell differentiation and promotes the development of bi-phenotypic lymphoid tumors that co-express CD3 and CD19, resembling human mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). SIK inhibitors impair MEF2C activity and alleviate the T cell development block. Importantly, this sensitizes cells to prednisolone treatment. Therefore, SIK inhibiting compounds such as dasatinib are potentially a valuable addition to standard chemotherapy for human ETP-ALL.",GOF

We aimed to characterize the histologic features of paediatric mesenchymal neoplasms with kinase alterations treated with targeted inhibitors.
Eight patients with tyrosine kinase-altered mesenchymal neoplasms with pre- and posttreatment samples were identified. Tumours occurred in five females and three males with a median age at presentation of 6.5 years. Tumour sites were bone/somatic soft-tissue (n = 5) and viscera (n = 3). Pretreatment diagnoses were: IMT (n = 3), epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma (n = 1), and descriptive diagnoses (n = 4) such as ""kinase-driven spindle cell tumor."" Fusions identified were ETV6::NTRK3 (n = 2), TPM3::NTRK1, SEPT7::BRAF, TFG::ROS1, KLC1::ALK, RANBP2::ALK, and MAP4::RAF1. Patients were treated with larotrectinib (n = 3), ALK or ALK/ROS1 inhibitors (n = 3), and MEK inhibitors (n = 2).

35543875,"In ulcerative colitis (UC), the molecular mechanisms that drive disease development and patient response to therapy are not well understood. A significant proportion of patients with UC fail to respond adequately to biologic therapy. Therefore, there is an unmet need for biomarkers that can predict patients' responsiveness to the available UC therapies as well as ascertain the most effective individualised therapy. Our study focused on identifying predictive signalling pathways that predict anti-integrin therapy response in patients with UC.
We retrieved and pre-processed two publicly accessible gene expression datasets (GSE73661 and GSE72819) of UC patients treated with anti-integrin therapies: (1) 12 non-IBD controls and 41 UC patients treated with Vedolizumab therapy, and (2) 70 samples with 58 non-responder and 12 responder UC patient samples treated with Etrolizumab therapy without non-IBD controls. We used a diffusion-based signalling model which is mainly focused on the T-cell receptor signalling network. The diffusion model uses network connectivity between receptors and transcription factors.
The network diffusion scores were able to separate VDZ responder and non-responder patients before treatment better than the original gene expression. On both anti-integrin treatment datasets, the diffusion model demonstrated high predictive performance for discriminating responders from non-responders in comparison with 'nnet'. We have found 48 receptor-TF pairs identified as the best predictors for VDZ therapy response with AUC ≥ 0.76. Among these receptor-TF predictors pairs, FFAR2-NRF1, FFAR2-RELB, FFAR2-EGR1, and FFAR2-NFKB1 are the top best predictors. For Etrolizumab, we have identified 40 best receptor-TF pairs and CD40-NFKB2 as the best predictor receptor-TF pair (AUC = 0.72). We also identified subnetworks that highlight the network interactions, connecting receptors and transcription factors involved in cytokine and fatty acid signalling. The findings suggest that anti-integrin therapy responses in cytokine and fatty acid signalling can stratify UC patient subgroups.

In particular, genetic variants located in the 3'UTR region of mRNAs may play an important role in gene regulation through their interaction with miRNAs. Existing studies have not been thoroughly conducted to elucidate 3'UTR variants discovered through GWAS. The goal of this study is to analyze patterns of GWAS functional variants located in 3'UTRs about their relevance in the network between hosting genes and targeting miRNAs, and elucidate the association between the genes harboring these variants and genetic traits.
We employed MIGWAS, ANNOVAR, MEME, and DAVID software packages to annotate the variants obtained from GWAS for 31 traits and elucidate the association between their harboring genes and their related traits. We identified variants that occurred in the motif regions that may be functionally important in affecting miRNA binding. We also conducted pathway analysis and functional annotation on miRNA targeted genes harboring 3'UTR variants for a trait with the highest percentage of 3'UTR variants occurring.
The Child Obesity trait has the highest percentage of 3'UTR variants (75%). Of the 16 genes related to the Child Obesity trait, 5 genes (ETV7, GMEB1, NFIX, ZNF566, ZBTB40) had a significant association with the term DNA-Binding (p < 0.05). EQTL analysis revealed 2 relevant tissues and 10 targeted genes associated with the Child Obesity trait.

COV434 cells, derived from a primary human granulosa tumor cell line, were studied under different cell density and well stiffness conditions. Cells were transfected with a TEAD-luciferase (TEAD-luc) reporter as well as expression constructs for AKAP13 or AKAP13 mutants and then treated with AKAP13 activators, inhibitors, and follicle-stimulating hormone.
TEAD gene activation or inhibition was measured by TEAD-luciferase assays. The messenger ribonucleic acid levels of Hippo pathway signaling molecules, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), baculoviral inhibitors of apoptosis repeat-containing 5, Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1, YAP1, and TEAD1, were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expressions for AKAP13, CTGF, YAP1, and TEAD1 were measured using Western blot.
Increased TEAD-luciferase activity and expression of markers for cellular growth were associated with decreased cell density, increased well stiffness, and AKAP13 activator (A02) treatment. Additionally, decreased TEAD-luc activity and expression of markers for cellular growth were associated with AKAP13 inhibitor (A13) treatment, including a reduced expression of the BIRC5 and ANKRD1 (YAP-responsive genes) transcript levels and CTGF protein levels. There were no changes in TEAD-luc with follicle-stimulating hormone treatment, supporting Hippo pathway involvement in the gonadotropin-independent portion of folliculogenesis.

35567571,"The DNA damage response (DDR) represents a complex network of proteins which detect and repair DNA damage, thereby maintaining the integrity of the genome and preventing the transmission of mutations and rearranged chromosomes to daughter cells. Faults in the DDR are a known driver and hallmark of cancer. Furthermore, inhibition of DDR enzymes can be used to treat the disease. This is exemplified by PARP inhibitors (PARPi) used to treat cancers with defects in the homologous recombination DDR pathway. A series of novel DDR targets are now also under pre-clinical or clinical investigation, including inhibitors of ATR kinase, WRN helicase or the DNA polymerase/helicase Polθ (Pol-Theta). Drug resistance is a common phenomenon that impairs the overall effectiveness of cancer treatments and there is already some understanding of how resistance to PARPi occurs. Here, we discuss how an understanding of PARPi resistance could inform how resistance to new drugs targeting the DDR emerges. We also discuss potential strategies that could limit the impact of these therapy resistance mechanisms in cancer.",LOF

35568723,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction has been recognized as an early pathological feature and contributing factor in multiple sclerosis. Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition is a process associated with endothelial dysfunction leading to the disruption of vessel stability and barrier function, yet its functional consequence in multiple sclerosis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition accompanied the blood-brain barrier dysfunction in several neurological disorders, especially in multiple sclerosis. The activity of transcription factor ETS1, which is highly expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) and responded to an inflammatory condition, is suppressed in the central nervous system (CNS) ECs in MS and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We identify ETS1 as a central regulator of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) associated with the compromise of barrier integrity. These phenotypical and functional alterations can further induce high permeability, immune infiltration, and organ fibrosis in multiple sclerosis, thus promoting disease progression. Together, these results demonstrate a functional role of EndMT in blood-brain barrier dysfunction and propose ETS1 as a potential transcriptional switch of EndMT to target the development of multiple sclerosis.",GOF

Therapeutic options to treat TNBC are limited and urgently needed. Strong evidence indicates that molecular signaling pathways have a significant function to regulate biological mechanisms and their abnormal expression endows with the development of cancer. PIM kinase is overexpressed in various human cancers including TNBC which is regulated by various signaling pathways that are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival and also make PIM kinase as an attractive drug target. One of the targets of the STAT3 signaling pathway is PIM1 that plays a key role in tumor progression and transformation. In this review, we accumulate the current scenario of the PIM-STAT3 axis that provides insights into the PIM1 and STAT3 inhibitors which can be developed as potential co-inhibitors as prospective anticancer agents.",GOF
35569185,"Thrombocytopenia (TP) remains a challenge in clinical hematology. TP may have serious consequences, such as recurrent skin and mucosal bleeding and increased risk of intracranial and internal organ hemorrhage. However, effective and safe therapeutic drugs for the long-term management of TP are still lacking.
This study aimed to identify more effective active compounds for TP therapy.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-nuclear magnetic resonance analysis was used to confirm the medicinal species and chemical structure of Hirsutine (HS). The proliferation of HS was examined by Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8) assay on cells lines. The effect of HS on megakaryocyte differentiation was analyzed by evaluating the expression of CD41, CD42b, and DNA ploidy via flow cytometry (FCM). The morphology of megakaryocytes and intermediate cells was observed using an optical microscope. K562 cells were then stained with Giemsa and benzidine. qRT-PCR was used to examine the mRNA expression of GATA-1, GATA-2, FOG-1, TAL-1, RUNX-1, NF-E2, and KLF-1 in K562 cells. Protein levels of the transcription factors were analyzed by western blotting. An MEK inhibitor was used to verify the relationship between the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and CD41/CD42b (FCM), FOG-1, and TAL-1. The Kunming thrombocytopenia mouse model was established by X-ray irradiation (4 Gy) and used to test HS activity and related hematopoietic organ index in vivo. Finally, computer simulations of molecular docking were used to predict the binding energies between HS-MEK and HS-ERK.
We preliminarily identified HS by screening a plant-sourced compound library for natural compounds with megakaryocytic differentiation and maturation (MKD/MKM)-promoting activity. We found that HS not only enhanced MKD/MKM of K562 and Meg01 cells, but also suppressed the decline of peripheral platelet levels in X-ray-induced myelosuppressive mice. In addition, HS promoted MKD via activation of MEK-ERK-FOG1/TAL1 signaling, which may be the key molecular mechanism of HS action in TP treatment. Molecular docking simulations further verified that HS targets the signaling protein MEK with high-affinity.
In this study, we report for the first time that hirsutine boosts MKD/MKM through the MEK/ERK/FOG1/TAL1 signaling pathway and thus represents a promising treatment option for TP.",GOF
35570134,"With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), monogenic forms of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) have been increasingly described. Our study aimed to identify disease-causing variants in a Western Australian CVID cohort using a novel targeted NGS panel. Targeted amplicon NGS was performed on 22 unrelated subjects who met the formal European Society for Immunodeficiencies-Pan-American Group for Immunodeficiency diagnostic criteria for CVID and had at least one of the following additional criteria: disease onset at age <18 years, autoimmunity, low memory B lymphocytes, family history, and/or history of lymphoproliferation. Candidate variants were assessed by in silico predictions of deleteriousness, comparison to the literature, and classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics-Association for Molecular Pathology criteria. All detected genetic variants were verified independently by an external laboratory, and additional functional studies were performed if required. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected in 6 of 22 (27%) patients. Monoallelic variants of uncertain significance were also identified in a further 4 of 22 patients (18%). Pathogenic variants, likely pathogenic variants, or variants of uncertain significance were found in TNFRSF13B, TNFRSF13C, ICOS, AICDA, IL21R, NFKB2, and CD40LG, including novel variants and variants with unexpected inheritance pattern. Targeted amplicon NGS is an effective tool to identify monogenic disease-causing variants in CVID, and is comparable or superior to other NGS methods.

These immune cells interact among themselves by releasing multiple mediators which eventually cause characteristic psoriatic plaques in the skin. T cells are reported to be significant contributors to psoriatic inflammation through release of multiple cytokines which are controlled by several kinases, one of them being Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck). Lck has been reported to be crucial for expression/production of several key inflammatory cytokines though modulation of several other kinases/transcription factors in T cells. Therefore, in this investigation, effect of Lck inhibitor, A-770041 was examined on PLCγ, p38MAPK, NFATc1, NFkB and STAT3, TNF-α, IFN-γ, Foxp3, IL-17A, in CD4+ T cells in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic inflammation in mice. Results from the present study exhibit that p-Lck expression is enhanced in CD4+ T cells of IMQ-treated mice which is concomitant with enhanced clinical features of psoriatic inflammation (ear/back skin thickness, MPO activity, acanthosis/leukocytic infiltration) and molecular parameters (enhanced expression of p-Lck, p-PLCγ, p-p38-MAPK, NFATc1, p-NFkB, TNF-α, IFN-γ, p-STAT3, and IL-17A in CD4+ T cells). Inhibition of Lck signaling led to amelioration of clinical features of psoriasis through attenuation of Th1/Th17 immune responses and upregulation of Treg cells in IMQ-treated mice. In summary, current investigations reveal that Lck signaling is a crucial executor of inflammatory signaling in CD4+ T cells in the context of psoriatic inflammation. Therefore, Lck inhibition may be pursued as an effective strategy to counteract psoriatic inflammation.",GOF
35581421,"Lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) is a histone demethylase frequently involved in cancer progression. This research aimed to explore the function of KDM5A in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and the molecular mechanism. KDM5A was highly expressed in collected PRAD tissues and acquired PRAD cells. High KDM5A expression was correlated with reduced survival and poor prognosis of patients with PRAD. Knockdown of KDM5A suppressed the proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasiveness of PRAD cells and reduced angiogenesis ability of endothelial cells. Downstream molecules implicated in KDM5A mediation were predicted using integrated bioinformatic analyses. KDM5A enhanced ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1) expression through demethylation of H3K4me2 at its promoter. ETS1 suppressed the transcription activity of miR-330-3p, and either further ETS1 overexpression or miR-330-3p inhibition blocked the functions of KDM5A knockdown in PRAD. miR-330-3p targeted coatomer protein complex subunit β2 (COPB2) mRNA. Downregulation of miR-330-3p restored the expression of COPB2 and activated the PI3K/AKT pathway in PRAD. The results in vitro were reproduced in vivo where KDM5A downregulation suppressed the growth and metastasis of xenograft tumors in nude mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that KDM5A promoted PRAD by suppressing miR-330-3p and activating the COPB2/PI3K/AKT axis in an ETS1-dependent manner.",GOF
35582959,"Mutation in Werner (WRN) RECQL helicase is associated with premature aging syndrome (Werner syndrome, WS) and predisposition to multiple cancers. In patients with solid cancers, deficiency of the WRN RECQL helicase is paradoxically associated with enhanced overall survival in response to treatment with TOP1 inhibitors, which stabilize pathological TOP1-DNA-covalent-complexes (TOP1cc) on the genome. However, the underlying mechanism of WRN in development of chemoresistance to TOP1 inhibitors is not yet explored. Our whole-genome transcriptomic analysis for ~25,000 genes showed robust activation of NF-κB-dependent prosurvival genes in response to TOP1cc. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, shRNA silencing, and under-expression of WRN confer high-sensitivity of multiple cancers to TOP1 inhibitor. We demonstrated that WRN orchestrates TOP1cc repair through proteasome-dependent and proteasome-independent process, unleashing robust ssDNA generation. This in turn ensues signal transduction for CHK1 mediated NF-κB-activation through IκBα-degradation and nuclear localization of p65 protein. Intriguingly, our site-directed mutagenesis and rescue experiments revealed that neither RECQL-helicase nor DNA-exonuclease enzyme activity of WRN (WRN",LOF

The new gene fusion involves the 5'-end of the promoter-containing N terminus of the SOX5 gene fused to exons 7-16 of the 3'-end of RAF1 gene leading to a SOX5-RAF1 fusion transcript which loses the auto-inhibitory CR1 domain but retains the complete in-frame coding sequence for the C-Terminal kinase domain of the RAF1. Stable expression of SOX5-RAF1 fusion induced growth factor-independent cell growth in murine hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells and melan-a immortalized melanocytes. Besides, it led to the transformation of both Ba/F3 and NIH 3T3 cells as revealed by colony formation assays. Furthermore, its expression results in MAPK activation assessed by increased levels of p-ERK protein in the cytosol of transduced cells. Treatment with Sorafenib and UO126 inhibited proliferation of Ba/F3-SOX5-RAF1 cells in the absence of IL3 but not the PLX 4720, a specific inhibitor of BRAF. Moreover, the tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of SOX5-RAF1 were assessed in vivo. These results indicate that SOX5-RAF1, a driver event for CMN development, has oncogenic capacity.

TAMs may be involved in the immunological escape of vicious clonal plasma cells (PC) in the bone marrow (BM) of sufferers with myeloma.
From March 2020 to January 2021, 28 healthy controls (HC) and 86 multiple myeloma (MM) (53 newly diagnosed MM [NDMM] and 33 remissions) patients were enrolled as objects of the study. The expression of TAMs in the BM, CSF1 on CD138 + cells, and CSF1R on macrophages were detected by the method of flow cytometry, and the expression of PD-1 on CD8 + T cells and PD-L1 on TAMs were also done. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were extracted and cultured into TAMs, CD8 + T cells were sorted by magnetic beads and cultured, a coculture system was established and different inhibitors were added. The expression of the perforin and granzyme B was detected by flow cytometry.

In this study, 38 and 33 jumps of elite ski jumpers were measured with a differential global navigation satellite system (dGNSS) on a normal (HS106) and large hill (HS140), respectively. For the steady glide phase, the average aerodynamic forces, lift-to-drag-ratio (LD-ratio), vertical and horizontal acceleration and velocity were measured and related to the jump distance as a performance outcome. The aerial time difference between the two hill sizes was 1.1s, explained by the time spent in the steady glide phase. The results for HS106 were in line with the assumptions in recent literature, which propose that the performance is largely determined by the take-off and glide preparation. Hence for normal hills, skiers should aim to reduce vertical acceleration through high aerodynamic forces during the glide phase. Also, no correlation was observed between the LD-ratio and jump length. The data from the large hill indicate that the performance during the steady glide is very important for performance; hence clear differences were found compared to the normal hill.

It is concluded that knocking down of ETS1 may reduce the renal tubular epithelial pyroptosis by regulating the transcription of NLRP3, thus relieving AKI. ETS1 is expected to be a molecular target for the treatment of AKI.",GOF

We aimed to compare the clinical and genetic characteristics of CCUS with lower-risk MDS and identify patients with CCUS with a high risk of progression. We performed targeted sequencing of bone marrow (BM) samples from patients with idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) (n = 139) and MDS (n = 226). Overall survival (OS) of patients with CCUS (n = 78) was worse than non-clonal ICUS (n = 61) and superior to lower-risk MDS (n = 99). Patients with CCUS showed similar characteristics to those with lower-risk MDS, except for higher haemoglobin, lower BM cellularity, and less frequent SF3B1 mutations. Lower haemoglobin, DDX41 (biallelic germline and somatic), ETV6, and RUNX1 mutations were independent prognostic factors for worse OS. Lower haemoglobin and DDX41 mutations were also associated with lower progression-free survival. Patients with CCUS with high-risk features showed similar or worse OS than patients with lower-risk MDS. Our findings suggest that patients with CCUS having certain clinical or genetic features should be regarded and treated as lower-risk MDS despite lacking significant dysplasia or MDS-associated chromosomal abnormalities.",GOF

This retrospective study originated from a single-centre TSC-specific cohort. We enrolled 273 individuals (138 males, 145 females; 2 years-7 years 6 months, mean 4 years 5 months, SD 1 year 6 months) with definitive TSC who completed TSC1/TSC2 genetic testing and were followed up to 2 years of age. The benefits of early attention and intervention were assessed by comparing epilepsy and developmental outcomes between groups with or without a prenatal diagnosis and with or without presymptomatic preventive intervention.
The epilepsy occurrence rate was significantly lower in individuals diagnosed prenatally than in individuals diagnosed postnatally (p = 0.027). In individuals diagnosed prenatally, the epilepsy rate in the preventive intervention subgroup was significantly lower than that in the subgroup without preventive intervention (p = 0.008). Significant improvements in cognitive, language, and motor development were observed in individuals diagnosed prenatally compared to individuals diagnosed postnatally and in the preventive intervention subgroup compared to the subgroup without preventive intervention (p < 0.05).
Based on this study, we cautiously speculate that early postpartum intervention may reduce the incidence of epilepsy and intractable epilepsy and improve developmental outcomes. Prophylactic intervention with sirolimus and vigabatrin may reduce the incidence of epilepsy. Larger prospective randomized controlled studies are required to support these findings.",GOF
35613501,"Jumping translocations (JT) are rare chromosomal rearrangements caused by the translocation of one donor chromosome segment to two or more recipient chromosomes. In the setting of myeloid neoplasms, JT are typically associated with disease transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and studies to date have found JT to be associated with poor prognosis and short overall survival. However, JT have been only very rarely reported in AML associated with a favorable AML prognostic cytogenetic marker. Additionally, JT have infrequently been described in hematological malignancies associated with autoimmune diseases (AID) such as Crohn's Disease (CD). Here we describe a case of a 40-year-old female with a 24-year history of CD diagnosed with AML harbouring the inv(16)(p13.1q22)/CBFB-MYH11 rearrangement in conjunction with sideline clones containing trisomy 13, tetrasomy 13, and a JT of chromosome 13q12 jumping to 7q32 and 18p11.2.

Nevertheless, the outcome of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) remains poor. In addition, due to limited access to intracranial tumour tissue, gene alterations associated with leptomeningeal metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma (LM-LUAD) are unclear.
Forty-five patients with LM-LUAD from May 2019 to June 2021 in Guangdong Sanjiu Brain Hospital were enrolled in this study. Seventy-five percent (34/45) of patients with LM harbored EGFR mutations, and patients with progressive disease (PD) of LM had 3rd-generation EGFR-TKI therapy and were defined as Cohort 1; those without 3rd-generation EGFR-TKI therapy were defined as Cohort 2. Next-generation targeted panel sequencing (NGS) was performed in each cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample of the two cohorts, and 9/45 LM-LUAD patients had matched plasma (PLA).
The common gene alterations discovered in the CSF of LM-LUAD were EGFR mutation (34/45, 75%), TP53 (25/45, 56%), CDKN2A (9/45, 20%), ALK (7/45, 16%), CTNNB1 (6/45, 13%), MET (5/45, 11%), APC (4/45, 9%), FGF4 (4/45, 9%), FGF3 (4/45, 9%), ERBB2 (4/45, 9%), and PIK3CG (4/45, 9%). Cooccurring mutations of TP53 and EGFR were found in 49% (22/45) of patients and correlated with poor prognosis. CDKN2A was identified in 20% (9/45) of patients and presented slightly shorter overall survival (OS) than those without (7.1 versus 8.8 months, p = 0.2). Cohort 1 had more genes associated with poor prognosis, consisting of CDK4, CDKN2A, PIK3CG, or PIK3CA, and YES1 and MET were more likely to be detected in cohort 2. The alteration of EGFR was comparable between CSF and matched PLA. Incidences of gene alterations such as CDK4, CDKN2A, MET, SOX2, JAK2, BRAF, and PIK3CG were more likely to be identified in CSF. All mutant allele frequencies (MAF) were much higher in CSF than in matched PLA.

The current state-of-the-art treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in combination or not with chemotherapy results in long-lasting remission and cure in more than 90% of newly diagnosed patients. These treatments have made relapse a rare event. The detection of PML-RARA transcript by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during treatment and follow-up can predict a hematological relapse. All studies have suggested a survival benefit in patients with molecular relapse given pre-emptive therapy compared with those treated at the time of overt hematological relapse. ATO-based regimens seem to be effective for achieving a second molecular complete remission (CR). Patients in second molecular CR are generally considered candidates for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), while for those with a persistent molecular disease, allogeneic HSCT should be offered if a suitable donor is identified.

However, the study falls short of finding a correlation between tumor regression or patient survival and the TSG count owing to a low number of cases meeting the study criteria.
The total TSG count alone cannot predict the biology of translocation-defined tumors. The addition of other parameters, including microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), and copy number heterogeneity (CNH), might be helpful.

Hence, in the context of T2D-associated complications, we examined the influence of high glucose, homocysteine, and LPS representing effector molecules of hyperglycemia, thrombosis, and infection, respectively, on human neutrophil activation to identify distinct signaling pathways by quantitative phosphoproteomics approach. High glucose activated C-Jun-N-Terminal Kinase, NTRK1, SYK, and PRKACA kinases associated with Rho GTPase signaling and phagocytosis, whereas LPS induced AKT1, SRPK2, CSNK2A1, and TTN kinases involved in cytokine signaling and inflammatory response.

We found that Wnt5a-Clathrin-mediated uptake leads to NFkB/p65 activation and that Wnt5a is secreted in an exosome-independent fashion. We uncovered that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and its derivative, Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), upregulate c-Rel expression that, as a result, blunts Wnt5a abundance by competing with NFkB/p65 on the Wnt5a promoter A. Wnt5a increases in ischemic stroke penumbra and blood, while DHA reduces Wnt5a abundance with concomitant neuroprotection. Peptide inhibitor of Wnt5a binding, Box5, is also neuroprotective. DHA-decreased Wnt5a expression is concurrent with a drop in NFkB-driven inflammatory cytokine expression, revealing mechanisms after stroke, as in RPE cells exposed to UOS. Limiting the Wnt5a activity via Box5 reduces stroke size, suggesting neuroprotection pertinent to onset and progression of retinal degenerations and stroke consequences. NPD1 disrupts Wnt5a feedback loop at two sites: (1) decreasing FZD5, thus Wnt5a internalization, and (2) by enhancing cREL activity, which competes with p65/NFkB downstream endocytosis.

Prior cell-based studies showed that POFUT1 modifies EGF repeats containing the appropriate consensus sequence at high stoichiometry, while Fringe GlcNAc-transferases (LFNG, MFNG and RFNG) modify O-fucose on only a subset of N1 EGF repeats. Previous in vivo studies showed that each FNG affects naïve T cell development. To examine Fringe modifications of N1 at a physiological level, we used mass spectral glycoproteomic methods to analyze O-fucose glycans of endogenous N1 from activated T cells obtained from mice lacking all Fringe enzymes, or expressing only a single FNG. While most O-fucose sites were modified at high stoichiometry, only EGF6, EGF16, EGF26, and EGF27 were extended in wild-type T cells. Additionally, cell-based assays of N1 lacking fucose at each of those O-fucose sites revealed small but significant effects of LFNG on Notch-Delta binding in the EGF16 and EGF27 mutants. Finally, in activated T cells expressing only LFNG, MFNG or RFNG alone, the extension of O-fucose with GlcNAc in the same EGF repeats was diminished, consistent with cooperative interactions when all three Fringes were present.

TAMs are predominantly M2-like polarized macrophages with tumor-promoting activities. Nonetheless, they can be repolarized to tumoricidal M1-like macrophages through macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition (CSF1Ri). CSF1Ri is being explored as multifaced therapeutic approach to suppress TAMs tumor-promoting functions and reduce cancer cell aggressiveness and viability. However, treatment with CSF1Ri results in significant TAMs death, thereby extinguishing the possibility of generating tumoricidal M1-like macrophages. Immunotherapy has improved overall patient's survival in some cancer types, but also caused frequent off-target toxicity. Approaches to balance efficacy versus toxicity are needed. Herein, a CSF1Ri loaded polymersomes (PM) based delivery platform is developed to promote M2-like macrophage repolarization. When testing in vitro on primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), CSF1Ri loaded PM are preferentially taken up by M2-like macrophages and enhance M2 to M1-like macrophage repolarization while minimizing cytotoxicity in comparison to the free drug. When testing in a MDMs-MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell co-culture model, CSF1Ri loaded PM further retain their M2 to M1-like macrophages polarization capacity.

35626200,"Vestibular schwannoma is a clinically benign schwannoma that arises from the vestibulocochlear nerve that causes sensorineural hearing loss. This tumor is clinically and oncologically regarded as a benign tumor as it does not metastasize or invade surrounding tissues. Despite being a benign tumor, its management is difficult and controversial due to the potential serious complications, such as irreversible sensorineural hearing loss, of current interventions. Therefore, preventing hearing loss due to the natural course of the disease and complications of surgery is a challenging issue for an otologist. Improvements have been reported recently in the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. These include advances in intraoperative monitoring systems for vestibular schwannoma surgery where the risk of hearing loss as a complication is decreased. Precise genomic analysis of the tumor would be helpful in determining the characteristics of the tumor for each patient, leading to a better hearing prognosis. These procedures are expected to help improve the treatment of vestibular schwannomas. This review summarizes recent advances in vestibular schwannoma management and treatment, especially in hearing preservation. In addition, recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying vestibular schwannomas and how these advances can be applied in clinical practice are outlined and discussed, respectively. Moreover, the future directions from the bedside to the bench side are presented from the perspective of otologists.",LOF

35626717,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates many processes during embryogenesis and the homeostasis of adult organs. Recent data suggest that central metabolic processes and signaling cascades in the liver are controlled by the Hedgehog pathway and that changes in hepatic Hedgehog activity also affect peripheral tissues, such as the reproductive organs in females. Here, we show that hepatocyte-specific deletion of the Hedgehog pathway is associated with the dramatic expansion of adipose tissue in mice, the overall phenotype of which does not correspond to the classical outcome of insulin resistance-associated diabetes type 2 obesity. Rather, we show that alterations in the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the liver lead to a metabolic phenotype that is resembling metabolically healthy obesity. Mechanistically, we identified an indirect influence on the hepatic secretion of the fibroblast growth factor 21, which is regulated by a series of signaling cascades that are directly transcriptionally linked to the activity of the Hedgehog transcription factor GLI1. The results of this study impressively show that the metabolic balance of the entire organism is maintained via the activity of morphogenic signaling pathways, such as the Hedgehog cascade. Obviously, several pathways are orchestrated to facilitate liver metabolic status to peripheral organs, such as adipose tissue.",GOF

Surgical treatment for VS has gradually declined over the past few decades, especially for small tumors. Gamma knife radiosurgery has become an accepted treatment for VS, with a high rate of tumor control. For neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)-associated VS resistant to radiotherapy, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy (e.g., bevacizumab) may become the first-line therapy. Recently, a clinical trial using a VEGFR1/2 peptide vaccine was also conducted in patients with progressive NF2-associated schwannomas, which was the first immunotherapeutic approach for NF2 patients. Targeted therapies for the gene product of SH3PXD2A-HTRA1 fusion may be effective for sporadic VS. Several protein kinase inhibitors could be supportive to prevent tumor progression because merlin inhibits signaling by tyrosine receptor kinases and the activation of downstream pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathways.

35628294,"Among the surrounding cells influencing tumor biology, platelets are recognized as novel players as they release microvesicles (MVs) that, once delivered to cancer cells, modulate signaling pathways related to cell growth and dissemination. We have previously shown that physiological delivery of platelet MVs enriched in miR-126 exerted anti-tumor effects in different breast cancer (BC) cell lines. Here, we seek further insight by identifying AKT2 kinase as a novel miR-126-3p direct target, as assessed by bioinformatic analysis and validated by luciferase assay. Both ectopic expression and platelet MV-mediated delivery of miR-126-3p downregulated AKT2 expression, thus suppressing proliferating and invading properties, in either triple negative (BT549 cells) or less aggressive Luminal A (MCF-7 cells) BC subtypes. Accordingly, as shown by bioinformatic analysis, both high miR-126 and low AKT2 levels were associated with favorable long-term prognosis in BC patients. Our results, together with the literature data, indicate that miR-126-3p exerts suppressor activity by specifically targeting components of the PIK3/AKT signaling cascade. Therefore, management of platelet-derived MV production and selective delivery of miR-126-3p to tumor cells may represent a useful tool in multimodal therapeutic approaches in BC patients.",GOF

The virus is present in most of the adult population as a persistent, asymptotic infection in the kidneys. During immunosuppression, JCPyV reactivates and invades the central nervous system. A main predictor of disease outcome is determined by mutations within the hypervariable region of the viral genome. In patients with PML, JCPyV undergoes genetic rearrangements in the noncoding control region (NCCR). The outcome of these rearrangements influences transcription factor binding to the NCCR, orchestrating viral gene transcription. This study examines 989 NCCR sequences from patient isolates deposited in GenBank to determine the frequency of mutations based on patient isolation site and disease status. The transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were also analyzed to understand how these rearrangements could influence viral transcription. It was determined that the number of TFBS was significantly higher in PML samples compared to non-PML samples.

Almost all (6/7) fractions had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of colon cancer cells, and two fractions (A-b and A-f) had considerable therapeutic indexes. The WCCPS fractions induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and induced different rates of apoptosis (≤48%). Transmission and scanning electron microscopy revealed that WCCPS fractions caused apoptotic changes in the nucleus and cytoplasm, including damage to mitochondria and external morphological signs of apoptosis. In addition, the WCCPSs induced an increase in the levels of Bax, cytochrome c, and caspases 8 and 3, indicating that cell death progressed through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Furthermore, some fractions caused a significant decrease of c-Myc, b-catenin, NFkB2, and HCAM (CD 44) levels, indicating enhanced cell differentiation.

The study aimed at evaluation of prognostic significance of the miR-128-3p/TERT expression in patients with primary neuroblastoma.
RNA samples isolated from fresh-frozen tumor specimens (n= 103) were reverse transcribed for evaluation of miR-128-3p and TERT expression by qPCR. The normalized expression levels were tested for correlations with the event-free survival (EFS). ROC-analysis was used to establish threshold expression levels (TLs) for the possible best prediction of the outcomes. The median follow-up was 57 months.
Both TERT overexpression and miR-128-3p downregulation were independently associated with superior rates of adverse events (p= 0.027, TL =-2.32 log10 and p= 0.080, TL =-1.33 log10, respectively).

This paper presents the study protocol and participation profile for the SIS study, aimed at assessing the role of schools in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission within school settings, and investigating how transmission within and from schools could be mitigated through implementation of school COVID-19 control measures.
SIS was a multisite, prospective, observational cohort study conducted in a stratified random sample of primary and secondary schools in selected local authorities in England. Six bio-behavioural surveys were planned among participating students and staff during the 2020/21 academic year, between November 2020 and July 2021. Key measurements were SARS-CoV-2 virus prevalence, assessed by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction; anti-SARS-CoV-2 (nucleocapsid protein) antibody prevalence and conversion, assessed in finger-prick-blood for staff and oral-fluid for students; student and staff school attendance rates; feasibility and acceptability of school-level implementation of SARS-CoV-2 control measures; and investigation of selected school outbreaks. The study received approvals from the UK Health Security Agency Research Support and Governance Office (NR0237) and London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Ethics Review Committee (ref:22657).
Data collection and laboratory analyses were completed by September 2021. A total of 22,585 individuals: 1,891 staff and 4,654 students from 59 primary schools and 5,852 staff and 10,188 students from 97 secondary schools participated in at least one survey. On average, across survey rounds, staff and student participation rates were 45.2% and 16.4% respectively in primary schools and 30.0% and 15.2% in secondary schools. While primary student participation increased over time, and secondary student participation remained reasonably consistent, staff participation declined across rounds, especially for secondary school staff (41.7% in Round 1 and 22.1% in Round 6). While staff participation overall was generally reflective of the eligible staff population, student participation was higher in schools with low absenteeism, a lower proportion of students eligible for free school meals and from schools in the least deprived locations (in primary schools 9.6% participants were from schools in the least deprived quintile compared with 5.7% of eligible students).
We outline the study design, methods and participation, and reflect on the strengths of the SIS study as well as the practical challenges encountered, and the strategies implemented to address these challenges. The SIS study, by measuring current and incident infection over time, alongside the implementation of control measures in schools, across a range of settings in England, aims to inform national guidance and public health policy for educational settings.",GOF

We herein investigated the molecular roles of EED in MYCN-amplified NB cells using EED-knockdown (KD) shRNAs, EED-knockout sgRNAs, and the EED small molecule inhibitor EED226. The suppression of EED markedly inhibited NB cell proliferation and flat and soft agar colony formation. A transcriptome analysis using microarrays of EED-KD NB cells indicated the de-repression of cell cycle-regulated and differentiation-related genes. The results of a GSEA analysis suggested that inhibitory cell cycle-regulated gene sets were markedly up-regulated. Furthermore, an epigenetic treatment with the EED inhibitor EED226 and the HDAC inhibitors valproic acid/SAHA effectively suppressed NB cell proliferation and colony formation.

Therefore, we aimed to characterize the properties of IL-17D in Amphiprion clarkii. We performed spatial and temporal expression, AcIL-17D-mediated antibacterial and inflammatory gene expression, NFκB pathway-related gene expression analyses, and bacterial colony counting and cell protection assays. We found that AcIL-17D contains a 630 bp coding sequence and encodes 210 amino acids. The spatial expression analysis of AcIL-17D in 12 tissues showed ubiquitous expression, with the highest expression in the brain, followed by blood and skin. Temporal expression analysis of AcIL-17D in blood showed upregulated expression at 6 and 24 h (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid and lipopolysaccharide), 12 h (all stimulants), and 48 h (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid and Vibrio harveyi). AcIL-17D expression in the blood gradually decreased at later hours in response to all the stimulants. After treatment of fathead minnow (FHM) cells with different recombinant AcIL-17D concentrations, the downstream gene expression analysis showed increased expression of antimicrobial genes in the FHM cells, namely [NK-Lysin (NKL), Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide-1 (HAMP-1), Defensin-β (DEFB1)] and some inflammatory genes such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-11, and STAT3. Further nuclear factor κB (NFκB) subunits (NFκB1, NFκB2, RelA, and Rel-B) showed upregulated gene expression at 12 and 24 h.

Recently, AKI has been linked to alterations in glycolysis and the activity of glycolytic enzymes, including pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). However, the contribution of this enzyme to AKI remains largely unexplored.
Cre-loxP technology was used to examine the effects of PKM2 specific deletion in podocytes on the activation status of key signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AKI by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In addition, we used lentiviral shRNA to generate murine podocytes deficient in PKM2 and investigated the molecular mechanisms mediating PKM2 actions in vitro.
Specific PKM2 deletion in podocytes ameliorated LPS-induced protein excretion and alleviated LPS-induced alterations in blood urea nitrogen and serum albumin levels. In addition, PKM2 deletion in podocytes alleviated LPS-induced structural and morphological alterations to the tubules and to the brush borders. At the molecular level, PKM2 deficiency in podocytes suppressed LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis. In vitro, PKM2 knockdown in murine podocytes diminished LPS-induced apoptosis. These effects were concomitant with a reduction in LPS-induced activation of β-catenin and the loss of Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) and nephrin. Notably, the overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of β-catenin abolished the protective effect of PKM2 knockdown. Conversely, PKM2 knockdown cells reconstituted with the phosphotyrosine binding-deficient PKM2 mutant (K433E) recapitulated the effect of PKM2 depletion on LPS-induced apoptosis, β-catenin activation, and reduction in WT1 expression.
Taken together, our data demonstrates that PKM2 plays a key role in podocyte injury and suggests that targetting PKM2 in podocytes could serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for AKI.

In addition, AP inhibited cleaved caspase 3-dependent apoptosis at the late anagen stage to postpone regression of hair follicles. More importantly, AP showed no cytotoxicity in keratinocytes and fibroblasts from both human and mouse skin.
This study clarified the effect of AP in promoting hair regeneration by activating HFSCs via Wnt signaling. Our findings may contribute to the development of a new generation of pilatory that is more efficient and less cytotoxic for treating alopecia.",GOF
35637626,"Hemangioblastomas (HBs) of the central nervous system are highly vascular neoplasms that occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Despite their benign nature, HBs are clinically heterogeneous and can be associated with significant morbidity due to mass effects of peritumoral cysts or tumor progression. Underlying molecular factors involved in HB tumor biology remain elusive. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and clinical and histopathological features in a series of 47 HBs from 42 patients, including 28 individuals with VHL disease. Thirty tumors occurred in the cerebellum, 8 in the brainstem and 8 HBs were of spinal location, while 1 HB was located in the cerebrum. Histologically, 12 HBs (26%) belonged to the cellular subtype and exclusively occurred in the cerebellum, whereas 35 HBs were reticular (74%). Unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction of DNA methylation profiles revealed two distinct subgroups. Methylation cluster 1 comprised 30 HBs of mainly cerebellar location (29/30, 97%), whereas methylation cluster 2 contained 17 HBs predominantly located in non-cerebellar compartments (16/17, 94%). The sum of chromosomal regions being affected by copy-number alterations was significantly higher in methylation cluster 1 compared to cluster 2 (mean 262 vs. 109 Mb, p = 0.001). Of note, loss of chromosome 6 occurred in 9/30 tumors (30%) of methylation cluster 1 and was not observed in cluster 2 tumors (p = 0.01). No relevant methylation differences between sporadic and VHL-related HBs or cystic and non-cystic HBs could be detected. Deconvolution of the bulk DNA methylation profiles revealed four methylation components that were associated with the two methylation clusters suggesting cluster-specific cell-type compositions. In conclusion, methylation profiling of HBs reveals 2 distinct subgroups that mainly associate with anatomical location, cytogenetic profiles and differences in cell type composition, potentially reflecting different cells of origin.",LOF

35637650,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common microvascular complication of diabetes and a major cause of end-stage renal disease, resulting in a substantial socioeconomic burden around the world. Some unknown biomarkers, mechanisms, and potential novel agents regarding DN are yet to be identified.
GSE30528 and GSE1009 were downloaded as training datasets to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of DN. Common DEGs were selected for further analysis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of DEGs were performed to explore molecular mechanisms and pathways. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was used to identify the top 10 hub genes of DN. Expression profiles of the hub genes were validated in GSE96804 and GSE47183 datasets. The clinical correlation analyses were conducted to confirm the association between key genes and clinical characteristics in the Nephroseq v5 database. The Drug Gene Interaction Database was used to predict potential targeted drugs.
345 and 1228 DEGs were identified in GSE30528 and GSE1009, respectively; and 120 common DEGs were found. The biological process of DEGs was significantly enriched in kidney development. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion, complement and coagulation cascades were significantly enriched KEGG pathways. The identified top10 hub genes were VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, TJP1, CTGF, FYN, SYNPO, PODXL, TNNT2, and BMP2. VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, CTGF, SYNPO, PODXL, and TNNT2 were significantly downregulated in DN. VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, CTGF, SYNPO, and PODXL were positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate. The targeted drugs or molecular compounds were enalapril, sildenafil, and fenofibrate target for VEGFA; losartan target for NPHS1; halofuginone, deferoxamine, curcumin, and sirolimus target for WT1; and purpurogallin target for TNNT2.
VEGFA, NPHS1, WT1, CTGF, SYNPO, and PODXL are promising biomarkers for diagnosing and evaluating the progression of DN. The drug-gene interaction analyses provide a list of candidate drugs for the precise treatment of DN.",LOF
35637958,"Inactive von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is linked to metabolic reprogramming and plays pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here, we identify a previously unknown oncogenic role for inactive VHL in actively triggering histone lactylation to promote ccRCC progression. In patients with ccRCC, inactive VHL positively correlates with the presence of histone lactylation, and high levels of histone lactylation indicates poor patient prognosis. Inactive VHL-triggered histone lactylation contributes to ccRCC progression by activating the transcription of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). In turn, PDGFRβ signaling is shown to stimulate histone lactylation, thereby forming an oncogenic positive feedback loop in ccRCC. Target correction of aberrant histone lactylation represses the growth and metastasis of ccRCC in vivo. More importantly, the combined inhibition of histone lactylation and PDGFRβ significantly reinforces the therapeutic efficacy. This work underscores the importance of histone lactylation in facilitating ccRCC progression and suggests targeting the positive feedback loop between histone lactylation and PDGFRβ signaling might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for ccRCC patients.",LOF

Genetic testing may be required for accurate diagnosis, which is critical for determining prognosis, screening recommendations, and treatment options. Our study aimed to compare the efficacy of germline-only versus paired (germline and tumor) genetic testing for clarifying the diagnosis in patients with features of NF2 and SWN. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients referred for NF2/SWN genetic testing at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2015 to 2020. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with diagnostic clarity. Overall, paired testing had 8.5 times greater odds of providing diagnostic clarity than germline-only testing (p < 0.01). Among patients who underwent paired testing, those who had analysis of two or more tumors had the greatest likelihood of gaining diagnostic clarity, with odds 13 times greater than patients who underwent germline-only testing (p < 0.01). Paired testing with analysis of one tumor significantly increased the odds of diagnostic clarity over germline-only testing by a factor of 6.5 (p < 0.01). These results have implications for genetic testing strategies and counseling patients about genetic testing utility. They also support the routine use of testing in individuals with suspected NF2 or SWN and improved insurance coverage for paired testing within this population.",LOF

TSC patients with renal lesions were subjected to TSC1/2 gene next-generation sequencing (NGS). TSC1/2 mutation types and imaging examinations were screened for combined analysis of genetic and clinical features. Seventy-three probands among TSC patients with renal lesions were included. Twenty affected relatives were also included. In total, 93 patients were included. Eighty patients (86.0%) had bilateral renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs), and one had epithelioid AML. Two patients had polycystic kidney disease, one had renal cell carcinoma, and one had Wilms tumor. Among the 73 probands, four had TSC1 mutations, 53 had TSC2 mutations, and 16 had no mutations identified (NMI). There was no statistically significant difference between TSC1 mutation, TSC2 mutation and NMI group (P= 0.309), or between familial and sporadic groups (P= 0.775) when considering AML size. There was no statistically significant difference between pathogenic/likely pathogenic and benign/likely benign/NMI groups (P= 0.363) or among patients with different mutation types of TSC2 (P= 0.906). The relationship between the conditions of TSC gene mutations and the severity of renal lesions still needs more analysis.

Rb1 reduced the body weight and adipocyte size. Improved glucose tolerance and increased basic metabolic activity were also found in Rb1 treated mice. MSTN was downregulated in differentiated C2C12 cells, 3T3-L1 cells and adipose tissues upon Rb1 treatment. FNDC5 was increased after Rb1 treatment. However, MSTN overexpression attenuated Rb1-mediated decrease accumulation of lipid droplets in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

35639425,"The Ups2-Mdm35 complex mediates intramitochondrial phosphatidylserine (PS) transport to facilitate mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis. In the present study, we found that ups2∆ yeast showed increased mitochondrial ATP production and enhanced quiescence (G0) entry in the post-diauxic shift phase. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed that the depletion of Ups2 leads to overactivation of the yeast AMPK homolog Snf1. Inactivation of Snf1 by depletion of an Snf1-activating kinase, Sak1 canceled the changes in mitochondrial ATP production and quiescence entry observed in ups2∆ cells. Furthermore, among the factors regulated by Snf1, upregulation of pyruvate carboxylase, Pyc1 and downregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Acc1, respectively, were sufficient to increase mitochondrial ATP production and quiescence entry. These results suggested that a normal PE synthesis mediated by Ups2-Mdm35 complex attenuates Snf1/AMPK activity, and that Snf1-mediated regulation of carbon metabolisms has great impacts on mitochondrial energy metabolism and quiescence entry. We also found that depletion of Ups2 together with the cell-cycle regulators Whi5 and Whi7, functional orthologs of the Rb1 tumor suppressor, caused a synthetic growth defect in yeast. Similarly, knockdown of PRELID3b, the human homolog of Ups2, decreased the viability of Rb1-deficient breast cancer cells, suggesting that PRELID3b is a potential target for cancer therapy.",LOF
35639629,"Peptide-drug conjugates that self-assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials have promise for uses in drug delivery. These discrete molecular species offer high and precise drug loading, affording efficient carriers for various therapeutic agents. Their peptide modules, meanwhile, enable biological targeting and stimuli-responsive function while also ordering the assembled nanostructure. The often hydrophobic drug payload likewise acts as a directive for self-assembly in aqueous media. Though accessible synthetic methods have allowed for extensive exploration of the peptide design space, the specific contributions of the drug molecule and its linker to the resulting assembly have been less explored. Hydrophobic drugs frequently have planar domains, conjugated π-systems, and isolated polar groups, which in turn can lead to specific and directional self-interactions. These energies of interaction affect the free energy landscape of self-assembly and may impact the form and assembly process of the desired nanomaterial. Here, two model supramolecular peptide-drug conjugates (sPDCs) are explored, composed of the corticosteroid dexamethasone conjugated to a conserved peptide sequence via two different linker chemistries. The choice of linker, which alters the orientation, rotational freedom, and number of stereoisomers of the prodrug in the final sPDC, impacts the mechanism and energetic barrier of assembly as well as the nano/macroscale properties of the resultant supramolecular materials. Accordingly, this work demonstrates the nonzero energetic contributions of the drug and its linker to sPDC self-assembly, provides a quantitative exploration of the sPDC free energy landscape, and suggests design principles for the enhanced control of sPDC nanomaterials to inform future applications as therapeutic drug carriers.",GOF

Here, we have used a disease-relevant model system to investigate the biophysical properties of the RNA-binding protein HNRNPH1's interaction with G-rich sequences. We demonstrate the importance of two EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich regions in mediating the exclusion of this exon from the oncogenic EWS-FLI1 transcripts expressed in a subset of Ewing sarcomas, using complementary analysis of tumor data, long-read sequencing, and minigene studies. We determined that HNRNPH1 binds the EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich sequences with low nM affinities irrespective of whether in a non-G4 or G4 state but exhibits different kinetics depending on RNA structure. Specifically, HNRNPH1 associates and dissociates from G4-folded RNA faster than the identical sequences in a non-G4 state. Importantly, we demonstrate using gel shift and spectroscopic assays that HNRNPH1, particularly the qRRM1-qRRM2 domains, destabilizes the G4s formed by the EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich sequences in a non-catalytic fashion. Our results indicate that HNRNPH1's binding of G-rich sequences favors the accumulation of RNA in a non-G4 state and that this contributes to its regulation of RNA processing.",GOF

While the majority of APL cases harbor a typical t(15;17)(q24;q21), atypical genetic mechanisms leading to the oncogenic PML::RARA fusion have been reported yet their frequency and scope remain poorly characterized. We assessed the genetic findings of 831 cases with APL investigated with concurrent chromosome banding analysis and dual-color dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) analysis at our institution over an 18.5-year timeframe. Seven-hundred twenty-three (87%) cases had a typical balanced t(15;17) with both testing modalities. Atypical karyotypic results including complex translocations, unbalanced rearrangements and insertional events occurred in 50 (6%) cases, while 6 (0.7%) cases were cryptic by conventional chromosome studies despite PML::RARA fusion by D-FISH evaluation. Atypical FISH patterns were observed in 48 (6%) cases despite apparently balanced t(15;17) on chromosome banding analysis. Two-hundred fifty (30%) cases displayed additional chromosome abnormalities of which trisomy/tetrasomy 8 (37%), del(7q)/add(7q) (12%) and del(9q) (7%) were most frequent.

It is also a model organism for the study of photoreactivation, which can be fully photoreactivated even after receiving high UV doses. However, for a long time, only one photolyase was found in S. elongatus that is only able to photorepair UV induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in DNA. Here, we characterize another photolyase in S. elongatus, which belongs to iron-sulfur bacterial cryptochromes and photolyases (FeS-BCP), a subtype of prokaryotic 6-4 photolyases. This photolyase was named SePhrB that could efficiently photorepair 6-4 photoproducts in DNA. Chemical analyses revealed that SePhrB contains a catalytic FAD cofactor and an iron-sulfur cluster. All of previously reported FeS-BCPs contain 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (DMRL) as their antenna chromophores. Here, we first demonstrated that SePhrB possesses 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (8-HDF) as an antenna chromophore. Nevertheless, SePhrB could be photoreduced without external electron donors. After being photoreduced, the reduced FAD cofactor in SePhrB was extremely stable against air oxidation.

The RET program was performed twice per week for 8 weeks; subjects performed the same RET exercises at similar total workloads (1920 arbitrary units [AUs] for the RET80% and 1950 AUs for the RET50%). The FMD% was measured before and after 8 weeks by ultrasound. Mixed factorial analysis of variance (3 groups × 2 measurements), effect size (ES), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were computed for FMD%. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.

35640153,"The shoot apical meristem (SAM), which is formed during embryogenesis, generates leaves, stems, and floral organs during the plant life cycle. SAM development is controlled by SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), a conserved Class I KNOX transcription factor that interacts with another subclass homeodomain protein, BELL, to form a heterodimer, which regulates gene expression at the transcriptional level in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Meanwhile, SKI-INTERACTING PROTEIN (SKIP), a conserved protein in eukaryotes, works as both a splicing factor and as a transcriptional regulator in plants to control gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by interacting with distinct partners. Here, we show that, similar to plants with a loss of function of STM, a loss of function of SKIP or the specific knockout of SKIP in the SAM region resulted in failed SAM development and the inability of the mutants to complete their life cycle. In comparison, Arabidopsis mutants that expressed SKIP specifically in the SAM region formed a normal SAM and were able to generate a shoot system, including leaves and floral organs. Further analysis confirmed that SKIP interacts with STM in planta and that SKIP and STM regulate the expression of a similar set of genes by binding to their promoters. In addition, STM also interacts with EARLY FLOWERING 7 (ELF7), a component of Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 complex (Paf1c), and mutation in ELF7 exhibits similar SAM defects to that of STM and SKIP.

35640446,"European health reforms during the last decades have strengthened patient rights and introduced choice, competition and financial incentives in a sector that has typically been state-directed and centrally controlled. The marketisation of health care has also drawn out profit and introduced private provision. The main argument behind this trend is that market competition will improve service quality and deliver health services more efficiently. Such reforms often fall under the umbrella of New Public Management (NPM), and there is a lack of empirical research on their effects. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between healthcare marketisation and health system outcomes across European nations. In order to measure a country's degree of healthcare marketisation we employed indicators of healthcare decommodification. The concept refers to the extent to which an individual's access to healthcare is dependent upon their market position and the extent to which a country's provision of health is independent from the market. These indicators are three measures that assess the financing, provision and coverage of the private sector, and thus reflects the varied role of the market in a health care system: private health care expenditure as amount of GDP, private hospital beds as amount of total hospital bed stock, and public healthcare coverage. As indicator of health system outcome, we employed a measure that has not previously been investigated in the context of healthcare marketisation: satisfaction with health care system. We used multilevel analyses on five waves (2009-2017) of the biannual European Social Survey (ESS), with our final models including more than 120,000 individuals from 21 countries. Our methodological approach allowed us to study both cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships. The strongest substantial associations were between coverage and satisfaction, with high public healthcare coverage being associated with higher satisfaction.",GOF
35640677,"Here we report that HES1, known to repress gene transcription in progenitor cells of several cell lineages, is strongly expressed in cells and tissues of T-cell lymphoma expressing the oncogenic chimeric tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK (ALK+TCL). The structure analysis of the orange domain of HES1 indicates that HES1 forms a highly stable homodimer. Of note, repression of HES1 expression leads to inhibition of ALK+TCL cell growth in vivo. The expression of the HES1 gene is induced by NPM-ALK through activation of STAT3 which binds to the gene's promoter and induces the gene's transcription. NPM-ALK also directly phosphorylates HES1 protein. In turn, HES1 up- and down-regulates in ALK+TCL cells expression of numerous genes, protein products of which are involved in key cell functions such as cell proliferation and viability. Among the genes inhibited by HES1 is TXNIP, encoding a protein implicated in promotion of cell death in various types of cells. Accordingly, ALK+TCL cells and tissues lack expression of TXNIP and its transcription is co-inhibited by HES1 and STAT3 in an NPM-ALK-dependent manner. Finally, the induced expression of TXNIP induces massive apoptotic cell death of ALK+TCL cells. The results revealed a novel, the NPM-ALK-controlled pro-oncogenic regulatory network and document an important role of HES and TXNIP in the NPM-ALK-driven oncogenesis, with the former protein displaying oncogenic and the latter tumor suppressor properties.",GOF

Genomic alterations associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapy, such as ERBB2 amplification, PIK3CA mutation, MAP2K1 mutation, and KRAS amplification, were identified in patients with left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mucinous metastatic colorectal cancer. Mucinous histology was not associated with a worse outcome than non-mucinous histology (34.3 vs 42.2 months, P = .85). However, patients with left-sided RAS/BARF wild-type mucinous colorectal cancer treated with first-line anti-EGFR therapy had significantly worse progression-free survival (4 vs 6.5 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-21.7, P = .01) than patients treated with the first-line vascular endothelial growth factor A antibody, bevacizumab. Anti-EGFR therapy was associated with limited responses and a short PFS across all lines of therapy in 12 patients with left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mucinous colorectal cancer.

An observational, analytical, and retrospective cohort study was carried out. Time to progression and OS rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival functions. Cox models were developed to assess association between time to progression and time to death, using a group of fixed variables.
Overall, 175 patients were included in the study; 33.7% of patients had luminal B HER2-negative tumors, 49.7% had bone involvement, and 83.4% had multiple metastatic sites. Tumor biology and primary tumor surgery were the variables associated with TTP and OS. Patients with luminal A tumors had the lowest progression and mortality rates (10 per 100 patients/year (95% CI: 5.0-20.0) and 12.6 per 100 patients/year (95% CI: 6.9-22.7), respectively), and patients with triple-negative tumors had the highest progression and mortality rates (40 per 100 patients/year (95% CI: 23.2-68.8) and 44.1 per 100 patients/year (95% CI: 28.1-69.1), respectively).

35641565,"Electroretinography (ERG) is used to evaluate the physiological status of the retina and optic nerve. The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of ERGs recorded with the RETeval system in diagnosing optic nerve diseases. Forty-eight patients with optic nerve disorders, including optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, traumatic optic neuropathy, and dominant optic atrophy, and 36 normal control subjects were studied. The amplitudes of the photopic negative response (PhNR) were recorded with the RETeval system without mydriasis. The circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT) was determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The significance of the correlations between the PhNR and cpRNFLT parameters were determined, and the receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were performed for the PhNR and cpRNFLT. Patients with optic nerve disorders had significantly smaller PhNRs compared to the control subjects (P = 0.001). The ROC analyses indicated that both PhNR and cpRNFLT had comparable diagnostic abilities of detecting optic nerve disorders with PhNR at 0.857 and cpRNFLT at 0.764. The PhNR components recorded with the RETeval system have comparable diagnostic abilities as the cpRNFLT in diagnosing optic nerve disorders.",GOF
35641658,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a heterogeneous disease. Our study aimed to understand the unique molecular features of preinvasive to invasive LUAD subtypes. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, histopathological, and molecular data of 3,254 Chinese patients with preinvasive lesions (n = 252), minimally invasive adenocarcinomas (n = 479), and invasive LUAD (n = 2,523). Molecular data were elucidated using a targeted 68-gene next-generation sequencing panel. Our findings revealed four preinvasive lesion-predominant gene mutations, including MAP2K1 insertion-deletions (indels), BRAF non-V600E kinase mutations, and exon 20 insertions (20ins) in both EGFR and ERBB2, which we referred to as mutations enriched in AIS (MEA). The detection rate of MEA in invasive tumors was relatively lower. MAP2K1 missense mutations, which were likely passenger mutations, co-occurred with oncogenic driver mutations, while small indels were mutually exclusive from other genes regardless of the invasion level. BRAF non-V600E kinase-mutant invasive adenocarcinomas (IAC) had significantly higher mutation rates in tumor suppressor genes but lower frequency of co-occurring oncogenic driver mutations than non-kinase-mutant IAC, suggesting the potential oncogenic activity of BRAF non-V600E kinase mutations albeit weaker than BRAF V600E. Moreover, similar to the extremely low frequency of MAP2K1 indels in IAC, BRAF non-V600E kinase domain mutations co-occurring with TSC1 mutations were exclusively found in preinvasive lesions. Compared with EGFR L858R and exon 19 deletion, patients with preinvasive lesions harboring 20ins in either EGFR or ERBB2 were significantly younger, while those with IAC had similar age. Furthermore, our study demonstrated distinct mutational features for subtypes of oncogene mutations favored by different invasion patterns in adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, our data demonstrate distinct mutational features between preinvasive lesions and invasive tumors with MEA, suggesting the involvement of MEA in the early stages of tumorigenesis. Further pre-clinical studies are required to establish the role of these genes in the malignant transformation of LUAD.",GOF
35641667,"Esophageal basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (EBSCC) is a poorly differentiated variant of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to investigate the clinicopathological and molecular biological characteristics of EBSCC and enrolled 58 patients with EBSCCs. Clinicopathological factors including age, sex, tumor size and location, gross tumor type (superficial, protrusive, ulcerative, and unclassifiable), lymphovascular invasion, infiltrative growth, intramural invasion, TNM stage, and dominant histological type were examined. EBSCCs were classified into four types (solid, cribri, microcystic, and tubular) according to the dominant histology. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a cancer hotspot panel was performed in 19 cases. NGS identified TP53 as the most frequently mutated gene, and copy number variation analysis revealed the most frequent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) loci. Target sequencing for TP53 was performed for the remaining 39 cases. We also performed LOH analysis for TP53, ATM, and RB1 and immunohistochemical staining for p53, ATM, and Rb in all cases. The rates of TP53 mutations and LOH and p53 aberrant expression were high (79.3%, 63.2%, and 72.4%, respectively); however, the frequencies were similar to those reported for ESCC. LOH rates of the RB1 and ATM loci were also high (55.3% and 67.2%, respectively). Overall survival rate was 66.5%, and recurrence-free survival rate was 55.0%. Only conventional clinicopathological factors had a prognostic impact in EBSCC; the microcystic type had the poorest prognosis. Our findings could be useful in developing novel treatment strategies for EBSCC.",LOF
35642038,"mTOR pathway is known to promote cancer malignancy and influence cancer immunity but is unknown for its role in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy.
Using Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center dataset (MSKCC), we extracted mTOR pathway gene mutations for stepwise Cox regression in 1661 cancer patients received ICI. We associated the mutation of the gene signature resulted from the stepwise Cox regression with the 1661 patients' survival. Other 553 ICI-treated patients were collected from 6 cohorts for validation. We also performed this survival association in patients without ICI treatment from MSKCC as discovery (n = 2244) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as validation (n = 763). Pathway enrichment analysis were performed using transcriptome profiles from TCGA and IMvigor210 trial to investigate the potential mechanism.
We identified 8 genes involved in mTOR pathway, including FGFR2, PIK3C3, FGFR4, FGFR1, FGF3, AKT1, mTOR, and RPTOR, resulted from stepwise Cox regression in discovery (n = 1661). In both discovery (n = 1661) and validation (n = 553), the mutation of the 8-gene signature was associated with better survival of the patients treated with ICI, which was independent of tumor mutation burden (TMB) and mainly attributed to the missense mutations. This survival association was not observed in patients without ICI therapy. Intriguingly, the mutation of the 8-gene signature was associated with increased TMB and PD1/PD-L1 expression. Immunologically, pathways involved in anti-tumor immune response were enriched in presence of this mutational signature in mTOR pathway, leading to increased infiltration of immune effector cells (e.g., CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and M1 macrophages), but decreased infiltration of immune inhibitory M2 macrophages.
These results suggested that mTOR pathway gene mutations were predictive of better survival upon ICI treatment in multiple cancers, likely by its association with enhanced anti-tumor immunity. Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.",GOF
35642174,"The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) anti-differentiation noncoding RNA (ANCR) is closely related to the occurrence and development of various malignancies. However, its expression and potential role in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) have not been established. In this study, we characterized the effects of ANCR in BCC and its underlying mechanism.
The expression of ANCR in BCC tissues and cells was detected by qRT-PCR. Proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis of ANCR overexpressed or knock down TE354.T and A431 cells were examined by CCK8, transwell assay, wound healing assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Western blot was performed to measure the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (BAX, BCL2 and Cleaved-caspase3), epithelial-mesenchymal transformation-related proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin and β-catenin), and Hedgehog-pathway-related proteins (PTCH, GLI1 and SMO). RNA pull-down assay was used to analyze the relationship between ANCR and PTCH. The effect of ANCR on BCC growth in vivo was analyzed using xenograft model. TUNEL assay was used to determine the cell apoptosis.
ANCR and Hedgehog pathway were more highly expressed in BCC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues. ANCR overexpression substantially promoted BCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, inhibited apoptosis, and up-regulated BCL2 and decreased the expression of BAX and Cleaved-caspase3 proteins. Additionally, the upregulation of N-cadherin, vimentin, β-catenin, PTCH, GLI1, and SMO expression, and downregulation of E-cadherin expression were observed after ANCR overexpression. Moreover, ANCR knockdown had the opposite effects. An RNA pull-down assay further revealed that ANCR is specifically bound to PTCH. In vivo experiments also showed that ANCR overexpression significantly increased tumor growth and decreased apoptosis, which was reversed by cyclopamine, a specific inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.
ANCR activates the Hedgehog signaling pathway by binding to PTCH, thereby promoting BCC progression; accordingly, ANCR could be a candidate therapeutic target in BCC.",GOF
35642348,"Primary anorectal melanomas (AMs) are uncommon neoplasms with aggressive behavior. Molecular profile and clinicopathologic features of AMs are still not well established. In this study, we aimed to investigate BRAF, NRAS, KIT, TERT, and GNAQ/GNA11 mutation status and clinicopathologic features of AMs.
All diagnostic slides of 15 AMs were reviewed. Histopathological and follow-up information were documented. Mutations in exon 15 of the BRAF gene; exons 2 and 3 of the NRAS gene; exons 9, 11, 13, 17, and 18 of the KIT gene; and exons 4 and 5 of the GNAQ/GNA11 genes and mutations in the promoter region of the TERT gene (chr.5, 1,295,228C > T and 1,295,250C > T) were analyzed.
BRAF(V600E) and KIT(V555I and K642E) mutations were observed in one (7%) and two cases (14%), respectively. NRAS, TERT and GNAQ/GNA11 mutations were not detected. The mean age was 65. Patients presented with rectal mass, rectal bleeding, pain, and weight loss. 73% of the lesions were macroscopically polypoid. The most common tumor cell type was epithelioid. Mean tumor thickness was 10.4 mm. One third of the cases lacked pigmentation. In situ melanoma was present in one third of the cases. Among 14 patients with follow-up data, 12 succumbed to disease. The mean overall survival was 36 months.
AMs are uncommon tumors with dismal survival, usually occurring in the elderly in various gross and microscopic appearances. In terms of molecular profile, BRAF and KIT mutations are rarely detected.

35642436,"Endometriosis is a progressive, estrogen-dependent, chronic inflammatory disease that affects approximately 6-10% of reproductive age women. Patients usually presents with symptoms, such as non-menstrual pelvic and abdominal pain, ovulatory pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, and/or changes to bowel or bladder function, which can be exacerbated during ovulation or menses. Endometriosis is a leading cause of unexplained infertility, accounting for up to 50-80% of cases. Currently, altered endometrial receptivity and progesterone resistance are some of the leading theories that could explain endometriosis-related implantation failure. In the endometrium, the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) protein forms a complex that binds to and inactivates regulators of the progesterone pathway, leading to progesterone resistance, aberrant decidualization, implantation failure, and recurrent miscarriages in women diagnosed with endometriosis. Surgical diagnosis consisting of laparoscopy, with or without histologic confirmation, is still considered the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis. Development of noninvasive screening and diagnostic tests to accurately identify patients with endometriosis has become increasing popular. A screening test for endometriosis has been developed to detect endometrial BCL-6 overexpression in asymptomatic women with unexplained infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss. Positive endometrial BCL-6 testing has been associated with recurrent miscarriages and poor in vitro fertilization outcomes. When the underlying cause of endometrial inflammation secondary to endometriosis was treated, an improvement in subsequent live birth rates was seen. Endometrial BCL-6 testing has a high positive predictive value that could help physicians and patients undergoing infertility treatment to seek surgical evaluation for endometriosis, to improve their reproductive outcomes.",GOF
35643150,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that causes severe neuropathology in newborns and adults. There is no ZIKV-specific treatment or preventative. Therefore, it is urgent to develop safe and effective anti-ZIKV agents. Hemin, an iron-binding porphyrin, has been authorized by FDA to treat acute porphyria since the 1970s. Here, we aim to evaluate the anti-ZIKV effect of hemin in SNB-19 cells (a human glioma cell line) and explore the underlying mechanism based on the virus life cycle and functions of the host cell. Our study found that hemin has a strong activity to protect SNB-19 cells from ZIKV infection presented by decreased expression of viral proteins and virus yield. Meanwhile, ZIKV infection caused STAT1/IRF1 signaling activation and induced inflammatory responses in SNB-19 cells, which was relieved by hemin treatment. HO-1 has been reported to be potently induced by hemin and play a broad-spectrum antiviral effect. Intriguingly, hemin could still exert anti-ZIKV activity upon HO-1 siRNA treatment. Then, we conducted a time-of-addition assay, the result indicated hemin works mainly by interfering with the virus entry process. Further experiments excluded the effects of hemin on AXL-dependent viral adsorption and clathrin-mediated endocytosis processes. Subsequently, by fluorescence spectroscopy studies, intracellular fusion assay and syncytia formation assay, we revealed that hemin acts on the process of virus-endosome fusion. This study elaborated that hemin could play anti-ZIKV activity by disrupting the virus-endosome fusion process and shed new light on developing novel agents against ZIKV infection.",GOF

High-quality data could be obtained for low expressed transcription factors using chemical crosslinkers (DSP) and reducing agent (DTT). We applied our D-CUT&RUN to detection of Bcl11b and Mycn binding sites in mammary epithelial progenitor cells. Pathway enrichment analysis results of Bcl11b target genes showed that Bcl11b was a regulatory factor involved in breast cancer and it could negatively regulate Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, the role of Bcl11b in breast cancer was mediated by catabolic process and stress-related pathway. Our research suggested that D-CUT&RUN could be used for low abundance transcription factor binding sites detection and Bcl11b could be a target for breast cancer treatment in the future.",GOF
35643235,"Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a lifesaving therapy for patients with intestinal failure. Hepatic steatosis is a potentially fatal complication of long-term PN, but the involved pathological mechanisms are incompletely unclarified. Herein, we identify the role of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the pathogenesis of parenteral nutrition-associated hepatic steatosis (PNAHS).
Proteomic/phosphoproteomic analyses of liver samples from PNAHS patients were applied to identify the mechanism of PNAHS. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) mice model, in vivo and in vitro experiments were used to assess the effect of PP2A-Cα on liver fatty acid metabolism.
Reduced expression of PP2A-Cα (catalytic subunit), enhanced activation of serine/threonine kinase Akt2 and decreased activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were associated with hepatic steatosis in PNAHS patients. Mice given PN for 14 days developed hepatic steatosis, down-regulation of PP2A-Cα, activation of Akt2 and inhibition of AMPK. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of PP2A-Cα in mice given PN exacerbated Akt2 activation, AMPK inhibition and hepatic steatosis through an effect on fatty acid degradation, whereas hepatocyte-specific PP2A-Cα overexpression significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis accompanying with Akt2 suppression and AMPK activation. Additionally, pharmacological activation of Akt2 in mice overexpressing PP2A-Cα led to the aggravation of hepatic steatosis.
Our findings demonstrate that hepatic PP2A-Cα serves as a protective factor of PNAHS because of ameliorating hepatic steatosis and improving liver function. Our study provides a strong rationale that PP2A-Cα may be involved in the pathogenesis of PNAHS.",GOF
35643390,"While vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been in use for over two decades, little professional guidance exists to describe dosing and titration of therapy which is the consequence of a limited amount of evidence developed during the pre-market phase of therapy development. Post-market surveillance of dosing practice has revealed significant deviations from dosing and titration guidance offered by professional societies as well as the manufacturer.
This analysis aims to identify a target dose for VNS Therapy in Epilepsy.
Herein, VNS clinical outcomes are linked to the patient-specific dosing parameters for each study visit (n = 1178 patients). A generalized linear mixed model was built to ascertain the relationship between key stimulation parameters (i.e., Output Current, Pulse Width, Signal Frequency, and Duty Cycle) and clinical response, defined as a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline. Other demographic parameters of interest, such as duration of epilepsy and age at implant, were also explored.
A population level target output current and duty cycle for VNS therapy for epilepsy was identified as 1.61 mA and 17.1% duty cycle. Patients with shorter duration of epilepsy were identified to have a higher likelihood to respond to VNS therapy (p < 0.001). While patients who were on the therapy longer were more likely to respond to the therapy, the effect did not interact with the dosing settings - suggesting that patients who have been chronically underdosed may still benefit from achieving the target dose.
An opportunity exists to improve upon VNS outcomes by aligning clinical practice around this evidence-based target dose.",GOF
35643725,"Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has nowadays been applied to non-small cell lung cancer harboring activated EGFR mutation with or without T790M, but ultimately develop resistance to this drug. Here we report a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to osimertinib and the reversal of which could improve the clinical outcomes. In osimertinib-resistant lung cancer cell lines harboring T790M mutation that we established, expression of multiple EGFR family proteins and MET was markedly reduced, whereas expression of AXL, CDCP1 and SRC was augmented along with activation of AKT. Surprisingly, AXL or CDCP1 expression was induced by osimertinib in a time-dependent manner up to 3 months. Silencing of CDCP1 or AXL restored the sensitivity to osimertinib with reduced activation of SRC and AKT. Furthermore, silencing of both CDCP1 and AXL increased the sensitivity to osimertinib. Either silencing of SRC or dasatinib, a SRC family kinase (SFK) inhibitor, suppressed AKT phosphorylation and cell growth. Increased expression of AXL and CDCP1 was observed in refractory tumor samples from patients with lung cancer treated with osimertinib. Together, this study suggests that AXL/SFK/AKT and CDCP1/SFK/AKT signaling pathways play some roles in acquired osimertinib resistance of non-small cell lung cancer.",GOF
35643978,"Anthropogenic activities and natural events such as periodic tree masting can alter resource provisioning in the environment, directly affecting animals, and potentially impacting the spread of infectious diseases in wildlife. The impact of these additional resources on infectious diseases can manifest through different pathways, affecting host susceptibility, contact rate and host demography. To date however, empirical research has tended to examine these different pathways in isolation, for example by quantifying the effects of provisioning on host behaviour in the wild or changes in immune responses in controlled laboratory studies. Further, while theory has investigated the interactions between these pathways, this work has focussed on a narrow subset of pathogen types, typically directly-transmitted microparasites. Given the diverse ways that provisioning can affect host susceptibility, contact patterns or host demography, we may expect the epidemiological consequences of provisioning to vary among different parasite types, dependent on key aspects of parasite life-history, such as the duration of infection and transmission mode. Focusing on an exemplar empirical system, the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), and its diverse parasite community, we developed a suite of epidemiological models to compare how resource provisioning alters responses for a range of these parasites that vary in their biology (micro- and macro-parasite), transmission mode (direct, environmental, and vector transmitted) and duration of infection (acute, latent, and chronic) within the same host population. We show there are common epidemiological responses to host resource provisioning across all parasite types examined. In particular, the epidemiological impact of provisioning could be driven in opposite directions, depending on which host pathways (contact rate, susceptibility or host demography) are most altered by the addition of resources to the environment. Broadly, these responses were qualitatively consistent across all parasite types, emphasising the importance of identifying general trade-offs between provisioning-altered parameters. Despite the qualitative consistency in responses to provisioning across parasite types, we predicted notable quantitative differences between parasites, with directly-transmitted parasites (those conforming to SIR and SIS frameworks) predicted to show the strongest responses to provisioning amongst those examined, whereas the vector-borne parasites showed negligible responses to provisioning. As such these analyses suggest that different parasites may show different scales of response to the same provisioning scenario, even within the same host population. This highlights the importance of knowing key aspects of host-parasite biology, in order to understand and predict epidemiological responses to provisioning for any specific host-parasite system.",GOF
35644022,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, characterized by an abnormal transformation of T cells into highly proliferative leukemic lymphoblasts. Identification of common genetic alterations has provided promising opportunities for better risk stratification in T-ALL. Current treatment in T-ALL still poses the major challenge of integrating the knowledge of molecular alterations in the clinical setting. We utilized the Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) method to determine the frequency of common copy number alterations (CNA) in 128 newly diagnosed T-ALL patients. We also studied the association of these CNAs with patient's clinical characteristics and survival. The highest frequency of deletion was observed in CDKN2A (59.38%), followed by CDKN2B (46.88%), LMO1 (37.5%), and MTAP (28.12%). PTPN2 (22.66%), PHF6 (14.06%), and MYB (14.06%) had the highest number of duplication events. A total of 89.06% patients exhibited CNAs. STIL::TAL1, NUP214::ABL1, and LMO2::RAG2 fusions were observed in 5.47%, 3.12%, and 0.78% of patients, respectively. CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and PTPN2 gene deletions were mainly observed in pediatric patients, while CNAs of NF1 and SUZ12 were observed more frequently in adults. In pediatric patients, alterations in CDKN2B, CASP8AP2, and AHI1 were associated with poor prognosis, while SUZ12 and NF1 CNAs were associated with favorable prognosis. In adult patients, ABL1 CNA emerged as an independent indicator of poor prognosis. The observed molecular heterogeneity in T-ALL may provide the basis for variations observed in clinical response in T-ALL and MLPA based CNA detection may help in risk stratification of these patients.

Although RUNX1 was considered as a beneficial tumor suppressor, several recent reports have shown the tumor-promoting role of RUNX1 in a variety of hematopoietic neoplasms. In this study, we assessed the effect of RUNX1 depletion in multiple human leukemia cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and confirmed that RUNX1 is in fact required for sustaining their leukemic proliferation. To achieve efficient RUNX1 inhibition in leukemia cells, we then examined the effect of lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery of RUNX1-targeting siRNA using two tumor-tropic LNPs. The LNPs containing RUNX1-targeting siRNA were efficiently incorporated into myeloid and T-cell leukemia cell lines and the patient-derived primary human AML cells, downregulated RUNX1 expression, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and showed the growth-inhibitory effect in them. In contrast, the LNPs were not efficiently incorporated into normal cord blood CD34+ cells, showing minimum cytotoxicity in them. Thus, our study highlights RUNX1 as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit leukemogenesis, and provide the LNP-based siRNA delivery as a promising approach to deplete RUNX1 specifically in leukemia cells.",GOF
35644389,"The discovery that insect larvae can feed on foam plastics provided new exploration ideas and potential for plastic wastes biodegradation. In previous studies, both attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) and conventional FT-IR have been used but no comparison has been done to evaluate the difference of effectiveness for the characterization of oxidization and biodegradation of plastics by insect larvae. To address this, foam plastics of polystyrene, polyurethane and polyethylene, as well as the frass of plastics-fed superworms Zophobas atratus were characterized using both FT-IR and ATR-FT-IR, and the differences were compared. For FT-IR, spectra were found to vary due to the difference in shape and thickness of the samples, as well as the moisture absorption of KBr. For ATR-FT-IR, although tests could be performed directly without pretreatment, the reflection with short wavelength could not deeply penetrate into the frass samples. Since the composition of plastics-fed larval frass is more complex than the original plastics, the spectra of FT-IR and ATR-FT-IR were observed significantly different. Therefore, the ATR-FT-IR was more effective in monitoring functional groups of original plastics, and be recommended to employ in combination with FT-IR for a more comprehensive characterization of plastics-fed larval frass in future studies.",GOF

The expression level of circ-0002814, microRNA 210 (miR210), Notch receptor 1 (Notch1), or cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 2 (CPEB2) was investigated by Reverse transcription Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The level of Notch1, CPEB2, and FUS (FUS RNA-binding protein) proteins was detected by western blot. The localization of circ-0002814 and miR-210 was determined by FISH assay. Cell proliferation and invasion were detected by EdU and transwell assays, respectively. The interaction between circ-0002814 and FUS protein was detected by RNA pulldown assay, while that between circ-0002814 and miR-210 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay.
The expression of circ-0002814 was decreased in the placenta and plasma of patients with preeclampsia. The ectopic expression of circ-0002814 promoted the invasion and proliferation of HTR8 cells compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Silencing circ-0002814 suppressed the invasion and proliferation of JEG3 cells compared to the control group (p < 0.05). circ_0002814-regulated Notch1 and CPEB2 by interaction with miR-210 and also regulated FUS/VEGF axis in HTR8 and JEG3 cells.
A low expression of circ-0002814 was detected in the plasma and placental tissue in preeclampsia patients. circ-0002814 participated in the proliferation and invasion of HTR8 and JEG3 cells. Thus, circ-0002814 may be considered as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for preeclampsia.",GOF

A series of practice-changing clinical trials has enriched the therapeutic perspectives of potentially curable NSCLC. While the CTONG1104 trial took the first step in investigating the adjuvant gefitinib - a first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), for the treatment of resected EGFR-mutated NSCLC - the subsequent ADAURA study marked adjuvant osimertinib as the standard of care for resected EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

Immunohistochemistry used to identify ALK, ROS1, PD-1, and PD-L1 proteins expression as well as ROS1 rearrangement via fluorescence in situ hybridization, in 70 NSCLC patients. Results were related to clinicopathological feature, survival, and treatment response.
Expression of ROS1, ALK, PD-1, and PD-L1 and ROS1-rearrangement were detected in 18.57%, 54.29%, 84.29%, 87.14%, and 15.71% of the cases, respectively. No association was found between ROS1, PD-1, and PD-L1 and any clinicopathological features, survival, or treatment outcome. ALK expression significantly associated with stage-IV and left-sided tumors. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and ALK-positive patients had significantly reduced progression-free survival than patients with wild type EGFR [HR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.37-2.93, p < 0.001] and negative-ALK expression [HR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.03-2.07, p = 0.03]. In multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis, EGFR-mutations, and ALK were independent predictors of NSCLC. PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with PD-1 but not with ROS1, ALK, or EGFR-mutation.
Positive ALK expression and EGFR-mutations are independent adverse predictors of NSCLC. Overexpression of PD-1/PD-L1 is not a significant prognostic marker in NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy, making them susceptible to immunotherapy. Since PD-1/PD-L1 expression is independent to oncogenic driver mutations, future studies into specific immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with targeted therapies for individualized treatment of NSCLC is warranted. Positive ALK expression and EGFR mutations are independent risk factors for NSCLC. Overexpression of PD-1/PD-L1 is not a significant prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC who are receiving chemotherapy, making them immunotherapy susceptible.

Some studies have suggested that combined drugs with divergent mechanisms may be promising in treating recurrent GBM.
Intracranial sustained (Z)-
Intracerebral (Z)-BP in residual tumors could not only inhibit cancer stem cells but also increase interferon gamma levels in serum, which then led to the regression of GBM and an immune-responsive microenvironment. Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases, including Axl and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) through (Z)-BP were determined to synergize CIK cells in the presence of pembrolizumab and TMZ in recurrent GBM. Therefore, this well-tolerated regimen could simultaneously block multiple cancer pathways, which allowed extended PFS and improved quality of life for 22 months.
Given the several unique functions of (Z)-BP, greater sensitivity of chemotherapy and the synergism of pembrolizumab and CIK cells could have affected the excellent prognosis seen in this patient with recurrent GBM.",GOF

In the experiment, we used the rapid thawing method to recover the cells and took the logarithmic growth phase cells for cell passage. We calculated the cell concentration and diluted the cells according to the experimental requirements. According to the standard curve, the corresponding sample protein concentration was calculated; at the same time, the Trizol method was used to extract the total RNA, the NanoDrop8000 spectrophotometer was used to determine the RNA concentration, and the RNA quality was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. We used immunohistochemical staining to complete the staining of lung cancer cells. Finally, black box testing was used to test the functional modules of the system.

However, its mechanism has not been made clear. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SCTWD on 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine-induced PLGC in rats and the mechanism of this effect. We found that SCTWD effectively repaired gastric mucosal injury, reversed the process of PLGC, and inhibited the occurrence of gastric cancer to some extent. In the results of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the number and arrangement of mucosal glands and the number of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria were improved in varying degrees; the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the PG I and PGR of the medication treatment group were significantly higher; a Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test showed that SCTWD could significantly upregulate the expression levels of Shh, Ptch, and Gli-1 in the gastric tissue of rats. The immunohistochemical method showed that SCTWD could significantly upregulate the protein expressions of Shh, Gli-1, Smo, cyclin D1, CDKN2A/p16INK4a, and NF-κBP65 and could reduce the expression of Ptch at the same time. Through the preliminary analysis of 75 compounds screened by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS, the main components, such as organic acids, esters and anhydrides, flavonoids, phenols, tanshinones, and so on, have anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor pharmacological effects. The results of KEGG enrichment analysis showed that 5 signaling pathways related to this project were found, and 33 differential genes were presented to construct the interaction network. These results suggested that SCTWD had a good regulatory effect on PLGC and thus may have a multi-targeted effect; SCTWD can not only significantly improve the pathological changes of gastric mucosa in rats with PLGC but also exert a strong effect of the regulation of the hedgehog signaling pathway.",LOF

Twenty resectable patients with LAGC who received BEV plus docetaxel/cisplatin/capecitabine (DCC) chemotherapy for 3 cycles with 21 days as one cycle as neoadjuvant regimen were involved. Besides, their treatment response, survival profiles, and adverse events were assessed.
In total, two (10.0%), 9 (45.0%), 8 (40.0%), and 1 (5.0%) patients achieved complete remission, partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease (PD) according to imaging evaluation, which resulted in 55.0% of objective response rate and 95.0% of disease control rate, respectively. Moreover, the number of patients with pathological response grades 1, 2, and 3 was 8 (40.0%), 8 (40.0%), and 3 (15.0%); while 1 (5.0%) patient did not receive surgery due to PD, thus the data of this patient was not assessable. Meanwhile, 18 (90.0%) patients achieved R0 resection. Regarding survival profile, the median disease-free survival or overall survival were both not reached.

The demographic data, symptoms of patients, location and size of the lesion, and surgical outcome were extracted from the articles.
Six studies, reporting the outcome of 33 patients were included in this review. In 26 patients, CM was identified as the epileptogenic foci and in others, CM was the source of headache or focal neurological deficits. LITT led to a satisfactory outcome in all patients except for three who achieved improvement in symptoms after the open resection of the lesion. Most of the post-operative complications were transient and resolved at the time of the last follow up. Cyst formation at the previous ablated CM site was reported as the long-term complication of LITT in one case.
LITT can provide a comparable outcome to the open resection of CMs, by having less invasiveness, even in deep and eloquent area lesions, and complications that are often temporary and disappear gradually. However, technical issues, such as thermal monitoring during the procedure, are considered a challenge for this procedure in CMs. Further studies with a larger population are needed to report this method's long-term outcome and complications on CMs.",GOF

In terms of expression status, circ-FLI1 was abnormally upregulated in CC patients' tumors and cells, paralleled with DKC1 upregulation and miR-197-3p downregulation. Most strikingly, there was a direct target relationship between miR-197-3p and circ-FLI1 or DKC1 based on the starbase database, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation. Functionally, the colony formation assay, MTS method, fluorescence-activated cell sorting method, cell cycle and apoptosis assays, and transwell assays were performed, and the results revealed that interfering circ-FLI1 and re-expressing miR-197-3p could restrict colony formation, cell viability, cell cycle progression, and migration/invasion of CC cells with apoptosis rate elevation; besides, they promoted oxaliplatin (L-OHP)-induced cell viability inhibition.

Relative levels of circRIP2 in 45 cases of CRC tissues and paracancerous tissues were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Its clinical significance in predicting pathological manifestations of CRC was analyzed. In vitro regulation of circRIP2 on proliferative and migratory abilities of Sw620 and HCT-116 cells was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and transwell assay, respectively. Dual-Luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments were conducted to reveal the interaction between circRIP2 and its target gene CBFB, as well as their co-regulation on CRC cell functions. At last, in vivo regulation of circRIP2 on CRC growth in nude mice implanted with HCT-116 cells was explored.
CircRIP2 was upregulated in these samples of CRC tissues and cell lines. High level of circRIP2 predicted advanced staging, and high risk of distant metastasis of CRC. In vitro knockdown of circRIP2 weakened proliferative and migratory abilities in Sw620 and HCT-116 cells. CBFB was downregulated in CRC tissues, which was negatively regulated by circRIP2 as its target gene. The attenuated proliferative and migratory abilities in Sw620 and HCT-116 cells with circRIP2 knockdown were abolished by co-silence of circRIP2 and CBFB. Moreover, in vivo knockdown of circRIP2 slowed down CRC growth in nude mice, and upregulated positive expression of CBFB in xenografted CRC tissues.

35647840,"The growing incidence of cancers is pushing oncologists to find out new explanations other than the somatic mutation theory, based on the accumulation of DNA mutations. In particular, the embryo-fetal exposure to an increasing number of environmental factors during gestation might represent a trigger able to influence the susceptibility of the newborn to develop cancer later in life. This idea agrees with the fetal programming theory, also known as the Barker hypothesis. Here the role of insulin-like growth factors, thymosin beta-4, and epigenome are discussed as mediators of cancer in prenatal human development. The role of epigenetic factors that during gestation increase the predisposition to develop cancer and the similarities in the gene expression (like MMP9, OPN, TP53 and CDKN2A) between embryonic development and cancer are key factors. Likewise, maternal obesity might be able to re-program embryo-fetal development with long-term changes, including an increased risk to develop neuroblastoma and acute leukemia. Birth weight alone and birth weight corrected for gestational age are proposed as important variables capable of predicting the vulnerability to develop cancers. According to the findings here reported, we hypothesize that cancer prevention should start during gestation by improving the quality of maternal diet. In conclusion, the Barker hypothesis should be applied to cancer as well. Therefore, the identification of the epigenetic factors of cancer appears mandatory, so that the cancer prevention might start in the womb before birth.",LOF

Sequential patients enrolled in LIBRETTO-001 at Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney with available imaging (n=22) were recruited. Patients had regular visits with AE documented and CT scans 3 monthly. CT at screening, at time of gastrointestinal AE and at most recent follow up were reviewed and scored. Endoscopic examination was performed in five patients.
Of 22 patients in this cohort, the majority had somatic RET alterations (n=18), most commonly p.Met918Thr (n=14). Ten patients (50%) developed gastrointestinal adverse effects. Dose reduction was required in 8 of the 10 patients, but none discontinued therapy. The majority had stable disease (n=17).

The implication of YAP1 and TAZ on intestinal epithelial cell differentiation is less clear. Using intestinal cell models in which the expression of YAP1 and TAZ can be modulated, our group showed that YAP1 inhibits differentiation of the two main intestinal epithelial cell types, goblet and absorptive cells through a specific mechanism involving the repression of prodifferentiation transcription factor CDX2 expression. Further analysis provided evidence that the repressive effect of YAP1 on intestinal differentiation is mediated by regulation of the Hippo pathway by Src family kinase activity.

35648428,"In patients with resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM), the choice of surgical technique and resection margin are the only variables that are under the surgeon's direct control and may influence oncologic outcomes. There is currently no consensus on the optimal margin width.
To determine the optimal margin width in CRLM by using artificial intelligence-based techniques developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and to assess whether optimal margin width should be individualized based on patient characteristics.
The internal cohort of the study included patients who underwent curative-intent surgery for KRAS-variant CRLM between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2017, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, and Charité-University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany. Patients from institutions in France, Norway, the US, Austria, Argentina, and Japan were retrospectively identified from institutional databases and formed the external cohort of the study. Data were analyzed from April 15, 2019, to November 11, 2021.
Hepatectomy.
Patients with KRAS-variant CRLM who underwent surgery between 2000 and 2017 at 3 tertiary centers formed the internal cohort (training and testing). In the training cohort, an artificial intelligence-based technique called optimal policy trees (OPTs) was used by building on random forest (RF) predictive models to infer the margin width associated with the maximal decrease in death probability for a given patient (ie, optimal margin width). The RF component was validated by calculating its area under the curve (AUC) in the testing cohort, whereas the OPT component was validated by a game theory-based approach called Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). Patients from international institutions formed an external validation cohort, and a new RF model was trained to externally validate the OPT-based optimal margin values.
This cohort study included a total of 1843 patients (internal cohort, 965; external cohort, 878). The internal cohort included 386 patients (median [IQR] age, 58.3 [49.0-68.7] years; 200 men [51.8%]) with KRAS-variant tumors. The AUC of the RF counterfactual model was 0.76 in both the internal training and testing cohorts, which is the highest ever reported. The recommended optimal margin widths for patient subgroups A, B, C, and D were 6, 7, 12, and 7 mm, respectively. The SHAP analysis largely confirmed this by suggesting 6 to 7 mm for subgroup A, 7 mm for subgroup B, 7 to 8 mm for subgroup C, and 7 mm for subgroup D. The external cohort included 375 patients (median [IQR] age, 61.0 [53.0-70.0] years; 218 men [58.1%]) with KRAS-variant tumors. The new RF model had an AUC of 0.78, which allowed for a reliable external validation of the OPT-based optimal margin. The external validation was successful as it confirmed the association of the optimal margin width of 7 mm with a considerable prolongation of survival in the external cohort.
This cohort study used artificial intelligence-based methodologies to provide a possible resolution to the long-standing debate on optimal margin width in CRLM.",GOF
35648444,"Transcriptional regulators select their targets from a large pool of similar genomic sites. The binding of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex (DCC) exclusively to the male X chromosome provides insight into binding site selectivity rules. Previous studies showed that the male-specific organizer of the complex, MSL2, and ubiquitous DNA-binding protein CLAMP directly interact and play an important role in the specificity of X chromosome binding. Here, we studied the highly specific interaction between the intrinsically disordered region of MSL2 and the N-terminal zinc-finger C2H2-type (C2H2) domain of CLAMP. We obtained the NMR structure of the CLAMP N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger, which has a classic C2H2 zinc-finger fold with a rather unusual distribution of residues typically used in DNA recognition. Substitutions of residues in this C2H2 domain had the same effect on the viability of males and females, suggesting that it plays a general role in CLAMP activity. The N-terminal C2H2 domain of CLAMP is highly conserved in insects. However, the MSL2 region involved in the interaction is conserved only within the Drosophila genus, suggesting that this interaction emerged during the evolution of a mechanism for the specific recruitment of the DCC on the male X chromosome in Drosophilidae.",LOF
35648632,"Preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder, is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk of the offspring in adulthood. In preeclampsia, endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) are reduced in number and function. Recently, we have shown that miR-1270, which is involved in cancer in vitro proliferation, migration, and tumor progression, is downregulated in fetal ECFC from preeclamptic pregnancies. We now hypothesize that miR-1270 dysregulation contributes to vascular endothelial dysfunction occurring after preeclampsia via ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) overexpression, the key kinase of DNA damage repair. Here, we show that miR-1270 silencing in normal ECFC and downregulation in preeclamptic ECFC are accompanied by an increase in the expression levels of ATM. Furthermore, ATM activation correlates with upregulated tyrosine kinase Src leading to phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin (vascular endothelial-cadherin) which subsequently compromises endothelial barrier permeability and morphodynamic cell parameters. Treatment with specific ATM inhibitors reveals a novel role of ATM upstream of tyrosine kinase Src activation. Subsequently, Src phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin compromise endothelial barrier permeability. Our findings suggest that downregulation of miR-1270 contributes to impaired ECFC function via the associated ATM overexpression, which further identifies ATM as a novel and critical factor for ECFC defects in preeclampsia. Our study provides new insights into the understanding of ECFC impairment associated with cardiovascular risk in preeclamptic offspring and identifies potential novel therapeutic targets.",GOF

However, the underlying mechanism dictating the regeneration program after PNS injuries remains poorly understood. Combining chemical inhibitor screening with gain- and loss-of-function analyses, we identified p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) as a crucial regulator of axon regeneration in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after sciatic nerve injury (SNI). Mechanistically, RSK1 was found to preferentially regulate the synthesis of regeneration-related proteins using ribosomal profiling. Interestingly, RSK1 expression was up-regulated in injured DRG neurons, but not retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Additionally, RSK1 overexpression enhanced phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion-induced axon regeneration in RGCs in the adult CNS. Our findings reveal a critical mechanism in inducing protein synthesis that promotes axon regeneration and further suggest RSK1 as a possible therapeutic target for neuronal injury repair.",LOF

One hundred twenty-seven eyes from 67 dogs were included in the study.
A full ECVO protocol electroretinography, which includes extensive rod and cone analysis, was performed on all dogs presenting for cataract surgery.
Our main findings were that amplitudes, but not implicit times of rod responses decreased with advanced cataracts. Amplitudes of the single flash rod and rod flicker responses were significantly lower in eyes with mature cataracts, and the former also decreased in hypermature cataracts. Cone flicker amplitude responses were also significantly lower in eyes with mature and hypermature cataracts. However, mixed single flash rod-cone and cone responses, with the exception of the mixed rod-cone a-wave amplitude in eyes with hypermature cataracts, were unaffected by cataract stage. The b-wave amplitude of the scotopic, mixed rod-cone, and photopic cone responses were affected by age and decreased by an average of 2.9, 7.5, and 1.5 μV/year, retrospectively (p < 0.01).
Lower ERG amplitudes in canine cataract patients may result from aging or the presence of advanced cataracts and may not indicate the presence of retinal disease.",GOF

35649362,"The MDM2 oncoprotein antagonizes the tumor suppressor p53 by physical interaction and ubiquitination. However, it also sustains the progression of DNA replication forks, even in the absence of functional p53. Here, we show that MDM2 binds, inhibits, ubiquitinates, and destabilizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). When cellular MDM2 levels are increased, this leads to accelerated progression of DNA replication forks, much like pharmacological inhibition of PARP1. Conversely, overexpressed PARP1 restores normal fork progression despite elevated MDM2. Strikingly, MDM2 profoundly reduces the frequency of fork reversal, revealed as four-way junctions through electron microscopy. Depletion of RECQ1 or the primase/polymerase (PRIMPOL) reverses the MDM2-mediated acceleration of the nascent DNA elongation rate. MDM2 also increases the occurrence of micronuclei, and it exacerbates camptothecin-induced cell death. In conclusion, high MDM2 levels phenocopy PARP inhibition in modulation of fork restart, representing a potential vulnerability of cancer cells.",GOF
35649376,"Endothelial and erythropoietic lineages arise from a common developmental progenitor. Etv2 is a master transcriptional regulator required for the development of both lineages. However, the mechanisms through which Etv2 initiates the gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) for endothelial and erythropoietic specification and how the two GRNs diverge downstream of Etv2 remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing a hypomorphic Etv2 mutant, we demonstrate different threshold requirements for initiation of the downstream GRNs for endothelial and erythropoietic development. We show that Etv2 functions directly in a coherent feedforward transcriptional network for vascular endothelial development, and a low level of Etv2 expression is sufficient to induce and sustain the endothelial GRN. In contrast, Etv2 induces the erythropoietic GRN indirectly via activation of Tal1, which requires a significantly higher threshold of Etv2 to initiate and sustain erythropoietic development.

Tumors recurred in distinct manners that were dependent on IDH mutation status and attributable to changes in histological feature composition, somatic alterations, and microenvironment interactions. Hypermutation and acquired CDKN2A deletions were associated with an increase in proliferating neoplastic cells at recurrence in both glioma subtypes, reflecting active tumor growth. IDH-wild-type tumors were more invasive at recurrence, and their neoplastic cells exhibited increased expression of neuronal signaling programs that reflected a possible role for neuronal interactions in promoting glioma progression. Mesenchymal transition was associated with the presence of a myeloid cell state defined by specific ligand-receptor interactions with neoplastic cells.

35649811,"Superconducting Radio Frequency (SRF) cavities used in particle accelerators are typically formed from or coated with superconducting materials. Currently, high purity niobium is the material of choice for SRF cavities that have been optimized to operate near their theoretical field limits. This brings about the need for significant R & D efforts to develop next generation superconducting materials that could outperform Nb and keep up with the demands of new accelerator facilities. To achieve high quality factors and accelerating gradients, the cavity material should be able to remain in the superconducting Meissner state under a high RF magnetic field without penetration of quantized magnetic vortices through the cavity wall. Therefore, the magnetic field at which vortices penetrate a superconductor is one of the key parameters of merit of SRF cavities. Techniques to measure the onset of magnetic field penetration on thin film samples need to be developed to mitigate the issues with the conventional magnetometry measurements that are strongly influenced by the film orientation and shape and edge effects. In this work, we report the development of an experimental setup to measure the field of full flux penetration through films and multi-layered superconductors. Our system combines a small superconducting solenoid that can generate a magnetic field of up to 500 mT at the sample surface and three Hall probes to detect the full flux penetration through the superconductor.

35649860,"The ab initio elongation (ELG) method based on a polymerization concept is a feasible way to perform linear-scaling electronic structure calculations for huge aperiodic molecules while maintaining computational accuracy. In the method, the electronic structures are sequentially elongated by repeating (1) the conversion of canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) to region-localized MOs (RLMOs), that is, active RLMOs localized onto a region close to an attacking monomer or frozen RLMOs localized onto the remaining region, and the subsequent (2) partial self-consistent-field calculations for an interaction space composed of the active RLMOs and the attacking monomer. For each ELG process, one can obtain local CMOs for the interaction space and the corresponding local orbital energies. Local site information, such as the local highest-occupied/lowest-unoccupied MOs, can be acquired with linear-scaling efficiency by correctly including electronic effects from the frozen region. In this study, we performed a local electronic structure analysis using the ELG method for various DNA block polymers with different sequential patterns.

Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were performed to elucidate how AR signaling regulates cellular epigenetic programs. Remarkably, ChIP-seq revealed novel DSRCT-specific AR DNA binding sites adjacent to key oncogenic regulators, including WT1 (the C-terminal partner of the pathognomonic fusion protein) and FOXF1. Additionally, AR occupied enhancer sites that regulate the Wnt pathway, neural differentiation, and embryonic organ development, implicating AR in dysfunctional cell lineage commitment.

35650206,"Acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) results from oligo-clonal evolution of B-cell progenitors endowed with initiating and propagating leukemia properties. The activation of both the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rac GEF) Vav3 and Rac GTPases is required for leukemogenesis mediated by the oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL. Vav3 expression becomes predominantly nuclear upon expression of BCR-ABL signature. In the nucleus, Vav3 interacts with BCR-ABL, Rac, and the polycomb repression complex (PRC) proteins Bmi1, Ring1b and Ezh2. The GEF activity of Vav3 is required for the proliferation, Bmi1-dependent B-cell progenitor self-renewal, nuclear Rac activation, protein interaction with Bmi1, mono-ubiquitination of H2A(K119) (H2AK119Ub) and repression of PRC-1 (PRC1) downstream target loci, of leukemic B-cell progenitors. Vav3 deficiency results in de-repression of negative regulators of cell proliferation and repression of oncogenic transcriptional factors. Mechanistically, we show that Vav3 prevents the Phlpp2-sensitive and Akt (S473)-dependent phosphorylation of Bmi1 on the regulatory residue S314 that, in turn, promotes the transcriptional factor reprogramming of leukemic B-cell progenitors.

de novo transcriptome analysis showed that 724 and 3,248 genes were differentially expressed due to low light intensity at T1 (35% light exposure) and T2 (10% light exposure), respectively, when compared to the controls. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were implicated in photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum by functional enrichment analysis.

Immunohistochemical staining data showed that a 43 of the 504 patients with GC (8.5%) were HER2-positive. In the HER2-positive cases, the expressions of c-Met and p-Smad2 were increased in accord with the lymph-node metastatic level. The overall survival of the HER2-positive GC patients with both p-Smad2 and c-Met expression was significantly (p = 0.030) poorer than that of the patients with p-Smad2-negative and/or c-Met-negative expression.

Nevertheless, the mechanism by which circRHOBTB3 regulates tumorigenesis in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains ill-defined. The present study determined the expression pattern and bio-effects of circRHOBTB3 in EOC. Furthermore, it revealed that circRHOBTB3 could serve as the ceRNA of miR‑23a-3p to facilitate PTEN expression, suppress proliferation, G1/S transition, invasion, and promote apoptosis in EOC.

This study focused on the influences of light qualities on volatiles accumulation in maize sprouts by integrating transcriptomic and metabolic works. Fatty acid derivatives, including nonadecane and n-hexadecanoic acid were highly existed in maize sprouts. Besides, aldehydes and apocarotenoids were accumulated in light qualities whereas unsaturated fatty acids and sesquiterpenoids were declined by light qualities. The enhancements on fatty acid and phenylpropanoids/benzenoids derivatives of blue light quality were stronger than that of red light quality. In addition, there were nuances between blue and white light qualities, hence blue light quality was supposed to be an alternative energy-saving choice for cultivating maize sprouts. A MYB transcription factor was upregulated in light qualities and might play negative roles on linolenic acid degradation. C2H2 probably involved in the discrepant accumulation of terpenoids in maize sprouts treated by blue and red light qualities.

35651273,"Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder with no effective therapies. Mutant huntingtin (mHTT), the main HD proteinaceous hallmark, has been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and mitochondrial dysfunction, among other pathological mechanisms. Importantly, Src-related kinases, c-Src and Fyn, are activated by ROS and regulate mitochondrial activity. However, c-Src/Fyn involvement in HD is largely unexplored. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore changes in Src/Fyn proteins in HD models and their role in defining altered mitochondrial function and dynamics and redox regulation.
We show, for the first time, that c-Src/Fyn phosphorylation/activation and proteins levels are decreased in several human and mouse HD models mainly due to autophagy degradation, concomitantly with mHtt-expressing cells showing enhanced TFEB-mediated autophagy induction and autophagy flux. c-Src/Fyn co-localization with mitochondria is also reduced. Importantly, expression of constitutive active c-Src/Fyn to restore active SKF levels improves mitochondrial morphology and function, namely through improved mitochondrial transmembrane potential, mitochondrial basal respiration and ATP production, but did not affect mitophagy. Additionally, constitutive active c-Src/Fyn expression diminishes the levels of reactive species in cells expressing mHTT.
This work supports a relevant role for c-Src/Fyn proteins in controlling mitochondrial function and redox regulation in HD, revealing a potential HD therapeutic target.

Diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for radiosensitivity are severely lacking. Our recently published studies demonstrated that the cell division cycle (CDC6) is a critical molecule contributing to radioresistance, and maybe a potential therapeutic target to overcome radioresistance. In the present study, we for the first time reported that Norcantharidin (NCTD), a demethylated form of cantharidin, re-sensitized radioresistant cancer cells to overcome radioresistance, and synergistically promoted irradiation (IR)-induced cell killing and apoptosis by inducing CDC6 protein degradation. Mechanistically, NCTD induced CDC6 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. By using small interfering RNA (siRNA) interference or small compound inhibitors, we further determined that NCTD induced CDC6 protein degradation through a neddylation-dependent pathway, but not through Huwe1, Cyclin F, and APC/C-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. We screened the six most relevant Cullin subunits (CUL1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and 5) using siRNAs. The knockdown of Cullin1 but not the other five cullins remarkably elevated CDC6 protein levels. NCTD promoted the binding of Cullin1 to CDC6, thereby promoting CDC6 protein degradation through a Cullin1 neddylation-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Between March 2019 and March 2021, 161 consecutive patients who had surgery due to acute appendicitis were ret-rospectively recruited from Trakya University in Edirne, Turkey. Group I included patients who had surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and Group II included patients who had surgery before the COVID-19 pandemic period. A total of 80 patients volunteered for Group I and 81 patients for Group II. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte/monocyte ratio were calculated. SII was calculated by the formula: platelet (P) × neutrophil (N)/lymphocyte (L). NLR was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the number of lymphocytes. SIRI was defined as follows: SIRI = (neutrophil × monocyte/lymphocyte). The Alvarado score was also calculated by using patient history, clinical examination, and laboratory findings.
There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of displacing pain, nausea/vomiting, right lower quad-rant tenderness, rebound, hyperthermia, leukocytosis, and total Alvarado score (p<0.001). There was a significant difference between two groups in comparison of C-reactive protein, SIRI, and SII values (p<0.001). Group I patients had higher values of these parameters than Group II.
Based on the results obtained from this study, we conclude that COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in patients with acute appendicitis admitted to the hospital. This late diagnosis of acute appendicitis caused more complications during COVID-19 pandemic. Alvarado score, SIRI, and SII can be used as a marker to indicate whether complications of acute appendicitis occurred pre- or post-operatively. Therefore, Alvarado score, SIRI, and SII are directly proportional to the complication of acute appendicitis.",GOF
35653060,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss. ALS is now associated with mutations in numerous genes, many of which cause disease in part through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are small sequences of DNA that can reduce expression of a target gene at the post-transcriptional level, making them attractive for neutralizing mutant or toxic gene products. Advancements in the medicinal chemistries of ASOs have improved their pharmacodynamic profile to allow safe and effective delivery to the central nervous system. ASO therapies for ALS have rapidly developed over the last two decades, and ASOs that target SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, and ATXN2 are now in clinical trials for familial or sporadic forms of ALS. This review discusses the current state of ASO therapies for ALS, outlining their successes from preclinical development to early clinical trials.",GOF
35653119,"Propagation of Ewing sarcoma (EwS) requires precise regulation of EWS::FLI1 transcriptional activity. Determining the mechanisms of fusion regulation will advance our understanding of tumor progression. Here we investigated whether HOXD13, a developmental transcription factor that promotes EwS metastatic phenotypes, influences EWS::FLI1 transcriptional activity.
Existing tumor and cell line datasets were used to define EWS::FLI1 binding sites and transcriptional targets. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and CRISPR-interference were employed to identify enhancers. CUT&RUN and RNA-seq defined binding sites and transcriptional targets of HOXD13. Transcriptional states were investigated using bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data from cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patient tumors. Mesenchymal phenotypes were assessed by geneset enrichment, flow cytometry, and migration assays.
We found that EWS::FLI1 creates a de novo GGAA microsatellite enhancer in a developmentally conserved regulatory region of the HOXD locus. Knockdown of HOXD13 led to widespread changes in expression of developmental gene programs and EWS::FLI1 targets. HOXD13 binding was enriched at established EWS::FLI1 binding sites where it influenced expression of EWS::FLI1-activated genes. More strikingly, HOXD13 bound and activated EWS::FLI1-repressed genes, leading to adoption of mesenchymal and migratory cell states that are normally suppressed by the fusion. Single-cell analysis confirmed that direct transcriptional antagonism between HOXD13-mediated gene activation and EWS::FLI1-dependent gene repression defines the state of EwS cells along a mesenchymal axis.
EwS tumors are comprised of tumor cells that exist along a mesenchymal transcriptional continuum. The identity of cells along this continuum is, in large part, determined by the competing activities of EWS::FLI1 and HOXD13.",GOF
35653145,"Patients selected to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) are usually those at higher risk of relapse, and there is a need to find better therapeutic options for these patients.
To determine the efficacy and safety outcomes for patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, ERBB2 (formerly HER2)-, high-risk early breast cancer enrolled in the randomized clinical trial monarchE who received NAC.
The monarchE randomized clinical trial was a multicenter, phase 3, open-label study that evaluated adjuvant treatment with abemaciclib plus endocrine therapy (ET) compared with ET alone in patients with HR+, ERBB2-, and node-positive early breast cancer who were at high risk of recurrence. Patients were recruited between July 2017 and August 2019 from 603 sites in 38 countries. This subgroup analysis was performed with primary outcome data, with a cutoff date of July 8, 2020.
Enrolled patients were randomized (1:1) to receive standard of care ET for at least 5 years with or without treatment with abemaciclib (150 mg, twice daily) for 2 years (treatment period) or until criteria were met for discontinuation.
Prior chemotherapy (NAC vs adjuvant vs none) was a stratification factor in monarchE, and and a prespecified exploratory analysis included outcomes in patients who received NAC. The data presented in this article are from the primary outcome analysis (395 invasive disease-free survival [IDFS] events; cutoff date, July 8, 2020; median follow-up 19 months [IQR, 15.6-23.9 months]). Invasive disease-free survival (the primary end point of monarchE) and distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard model and Kaplan-Meier method.
Of the 5637 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.9 [10.6] years; 2046 women [99.5%]; 462 Asian [22.8%], 54 Black [2.7%], and 1473 White participants [70.8%]) enrolled in monarchE, 2056 (37%) received treatment with NAC. In this subgroup, treatment with abemaciclib and ET demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit in IDFS (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.80) and DRFS (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46-0.81), which corresponded with an absolute improvement of 6.6% in 2-year IDFS rates and 6.7% in 2-year DRFS rates. A consistent treatment benefit was observed across subgroups of pathological breast tumor size or number of positive lymph nodes at surgery.
In the randomized clinical trial monarchE, treatment with adjuvant abemaciclib combined with ET demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in IDFS and DRFS for patients with HR+, ERBB2-, node-positive, high-risk early breast cancer who received NAC before trial enrollment.

35653148,"Endocrine therapy resistance (ETR) remains the greatest challenge in treating patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. We set out to identify molecular mechanisms underlying ETR through in-depth genomic analysis of breast tumors.
We collected pre-treatment and sequential on-treatment tumor samples from 35 patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant then adjuvant ET; 3 had intrinsic resistance, 19 acquired resistance, and 13 remained sensitive. Response was determined by changes in tumor volume neoadjuvantly and by monitoring for adjuvant recurrence. Twelve patients received 2 or more lines of ET, with subsequent treatment lines being initiated at the time of development of resistance to the previous ET. DNA whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing were performed on all samples, totalling 169 unique specimens. DNA mutations, copy number alterations and gene expression data were analyzed through unsupervised and supervised analyses to identify molecular features related to ETR.
Mutations enriched in ETR included ESR1 and GATA3. The known ESR1 D538G variant conferring ETR was identified, as was a rarer E380Q variant that confers endocrine hypersensitivity. Resistant tumors which acquired resistance had distinct gene expression profiles compared to paired sensitive tumors, showing elevated pathways including ER, HER2, GATA3, AKT, RAS and p63 signaling. Integrated analysis in individual patients highlighted the diversity of ETR mechanisms.
The mechanisms underlying ETR are multiple and characterized by diverse changes in both somatic genetic and transcriptomic profiles; to overcome resistance will require an individualized approach utilizing genomic and genetic biomarkers and drugs tailored to each patient.",GOF

The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a guided, indicated web-based prevention program for women at risk for AN.
We conducted a randomized controlled efficacy trial for women at risk for AN. Assessments were carried out at baseline (before the intervention), after the intervention (10 weeks after baseline), and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups (FUs). A total of 168 women with low body weight (17.5 kg/m
Data were available for 81.5% (137/168) of the women after the intervention and for 69% (116/168) of the women at 12-month FU. At 12-month FU, the IG participants showed larger decreases in Eating Disorder Examination total scores (38/48, 79% vs 33/58, 57%) than the CG participants and the IG participants who were underweight also showed larger clinically relevant increases in BMI (15/31, 49% vs 10/32, 32%) than the CG participants, but these differences were not significant. In addition, after the intervention and at 12-month FU, we found a significant increase in continuously measured BMI for the participants who were underweight and significant improvements in disordered eating attitudes and behaviors (eg, restrained eating as well as weight and shape concerns). At all time points, the rates of new-onset eating disorder cases were (nonsignificantly) lower in the IG than in the CG and the reductions in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-based eating disorder syndromes were (nonsignificantly) higher in the IG than in the CG.
SB-AN is the first preventive intervention shown to significantly reduce specific risk factors for, and symptoms of, AN and shows promise for reducing full-syndrome AN onset.

35653190,"Mitochondrial proteostasis, regulated by the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), is crucial for maintenance of cellular functions and survival. Elevated oxidative and proteotoxic stress in mitochondria must be attenuated by the activation of ubiquitous UPRmt to promote prostate cancer (PCa) growth. Here we show that the two key components of the UPRmt, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60, a mitochondrial chaperonin) and caseinolytic protease (ClpP, a mitochondrial protease) were required for the development of advanced PCa. HSP60 regulated ClpP expression via c-Myc and physically interacted with ClpP to restore mitochondrial functions promoting cancer cell survival. HSP60 maintained the ATP-producing functions of mitochondria, which activated β-catenin pathway leading to the upregulation of c-Myc. We identified an UPRmt inhibitor that blocked HSP60 interaction with ClpP and abrogated survival signaling without altering HSP60 chaperonin function. Disruption of HSP60-ClpP interaction by UPRmt inhibitor triggered metabolic stress and impeded PCa promoting signaling. Treatment with UPRmt inhibitor, or genetic ablation of Hsp60, inhibited PCa growth and progression. Together, our findings identify that HSP60-ClpP mediated UPRmt is essential for prostate tumorigenesis and HSP60-ClpP interaction represents a therapeutic vulnerability in PCa.",GOF
35653194,"Novel therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapeutics, targeting glioblastoma (GBM) often fail in the clinic, at least partly because available preclinical models in which hypotheses are being tested, do not recapitulate the human disease. To address this challenge, we took advantage of our previously developed spontaneous Qk/trp53/Pten (QPP) triple-knockout model of human GBM, and compared its immune microenvironment components with those of patient-derived tumors in effort to determine whether this model might provide an opportunity for gaining insights into tumor physiopathology as well as for preclinical evaluation of therapeutic agents. Immune profiling analyses and single-cell sequencing of implanted and spontaneous tumors from QPP mice as well as from GBM patients revealed intratumoral immune components that were predominantly myeloid cells (e.g. monocytes, macrophages, and microglia) with minor populations of T, B, and NK cells. When comparing spontaneous and implanted mouse samples, we found that there were more neutrophils, T and NK cells in the implanted model. Neutrophils, T and NK cells were increased in abundance in samples derived from human high-grade glioma (HGG) compared to those derived from low grade glioma (LGG). Overall, our data demonstrate that our implanted and spontaneous QPP models recapitulate the immunosuppressive myeloid dominant nature of the tumor microenvironment of human gliomas. Our model provides a suitable tool for investigating the complex immune compartment of gliomas and it may contribute to a better understanding of the resistance of human glioblastoma to currently available immunotherapeutics.",LOF
35653257,"Bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is a tradable and desirable crop; however, its perishable nature requires low-temperature handling. Paradoxically, cold causes chilling injury (CI) and postharvest waste. Current knowledge about CI in pepper is limited. The mechanism of CI is multi-faceted; thus, this study focused on fatty acid desaturation and identified an upstream nuclear transcription factor (TF) CaMYB340 belonging to the R2R3 MYB subfamily that negatively regulates fatty acid desaturation and CaCBF3, and is induced by low temperature (4°C) at the DNA and transcriptional levels. Specifically, McrBC treatment and bisulfite sequencing PCR indicate that exposure to cold triggers DNA methylation on one of the CHH sites in the CaMYB340 promoter. This epigenetic event at least partly contributes to the upregulation of CaMYB340 transcripts. Increased expression of CaMYB340 results in the formation of protein complexes with CaMYB340, CabHLH93, and CaMYB1R1 that in turn downregulates the expression of downstream genes. For peppers held at low temperature, transient overexpression of CaMYB340 reduced unsaturated fatty acid (FA) content and membrane fluidity, resulting in cold-induced poor peel texture. Transient CaMYB340 silencing increased FA desaturation and lowered electrolyte leakage, enhancing cold tolerance in CaMYB340 RNA interference (CaMYB340-RNAi) fruits. Overall, these results underscore the intricacy of transcriptional networks in plants and highlight the role of CaMYB340 in CI occurrence in pepper fruits.",GOF
35653267,": From a therapeutic standpoint, invasive cervical cancer can be designated as early, locally advanced, and advanced stages. Systemic treatment remains the primary therapeutical modality for advanced cervical cancer patients who are not candidates for local curative treatments (surgery and radiation).
In this review, the author discusses recent clinical studies published in PubMed on the treatment of advanced cervical carcinoma. The author also provides his expert perspectives on the current state of play.
: Survival outcomes for advanced cervical cancer patients have been steadily improving since 1981, when single-agent cisplatin was adopted as the standard of care. In 2014, bevacizumab increased median overall survival (MOS) to 17 months when combined with standard chemotherapy (platinum-paclitaxel). In 2021, the checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) pembrolizumab, when used in the first line added to platinum-paclitaxel-bevacizumab, increased mOS to 24 months. Two other CPIs are in phase III trials as first-line treatments. As for second-line therapy, cemiplimab has shown increased survival compared to single-agent chemotherapy, and a phase III trial with tisotumab vedotin is currently ongoing. Nevertheless, there is still an unmet need for new more effective treatments and significant efforts are needed in the discovery of drugs for advanced cervical cancer beyond the current ""me-too"" drugs.",GOF

The shell of Trapa bispinosa has anticancer activity, maybe due to its high content of polyphenols. There are few studies on the chemical composition of Trapa bispinosa shells, then we isolated the active components from Trapa bispinosa shell and clarified the mechanism of its anticancer activity. One monomer compound was separated from the ethanol extract of the Trapa bispinosa shell by fractional extraction, silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 gel column chromatography and liquid phase separation. The structure, identified by NMR was 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose. The results of the CCK-8 assay showed that 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose could significantly inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, and the effect was close to that of 5-fluorouracil. Here, 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose could affect the cell cycle of SGC7901 cells. At the dose of 200 μg/mL and an incubation time of 48 h, SGC7901 cells remained in the G1 phase, apoptosis occurred, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increased and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the P53 signalling pathway associated with apoptosis. The results of qPCR and Western blot showed that 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose could induce apoptosis of SGC7901 cells by up-regulating the expression levels of P21, PUMA, PERP and IGF-BP3 genes, down-regulating the CyclinD gene, increasing the expression levels of cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9 protein and decreasing that of the protein BCL-2.",GOF
35653424,"A primary goal of biomedical research is to elucidate molecular mechanisms, particularly those responsible for human traits, either normal or pathological. Yet achieving this goal is difficult if not practically impossible when the traits of interest lack tractable models and so cannot be dissected through time-honored approaches like forward genetics or reconstitution. Arguably, no biological problem has hindered scientific progress more than this: the inability to dissect a trait's mechanism without a tractable likeness of the trait. At root, forward genetics and reconstitution are powerful approaches because they assay for specific molecular functions. Here, we discuss an alternative way to uncover important mechanistic interactions, namely, to assay for positive natural selection. If an interaction has been selected for, then it must perform an important function, a function that significantly promotes reproductive success. Accordingly, selection is a consequence and indicator of function, and uncovering multimolecular selection will reveal important functional interactions. We propose a selection signature for interactions and review recent selection-based approaches through which to dissect traits that are not inherently tractable. The review includes proof-of-principle studies in which important interactions were uncovered by screening for selection. In sum, screens for selection appear feasible when screens for specific functions are not. Selection screens thus constitute a novel tool through which to reveal the mechanisms that shape the fates of organisms.",GOF
35653503,"We present an approach combining alchemical modifications and physical-pathway methods to calculate absolute binding free energies. The employed physical-pathway method is either a stratified umbrella sampling to calculate a potential of mean force or nonequilibrium pulling. We devised two basic approaches: the simultaneous approach (S-approach), where, along the physical unbinding pathway, an alchemical transformation of ligand-protein interactions is installed and deinstalled, and the prior-plus-simultaneous approach (PPS-approach), where, prior to the physical-pathway simulation, an alchemical transformation of ligand-protein interactions is installed in the binding site and deinstalled during the physical-pathway simulation. Using a mutant of T4 lysozyme with a benzene ligand as an example, we show that installation and deinstallation of soft-core interactions concurrent with physical ligand unbinding (S-approach) allow successful potential of mean force calculations and nonequilibrium pulling simulations despite the problems posed by the occluded nature of the lysozyme binding pocket. Good agreement between the potential of the mean-force-based S-approach and double decoupling simulations as well as a remarkable efficiency and accuracy of the nonequilibrium-pulling-based S-approach is found. The latter turned out to be more compute-efficient than the potential of mean force calculation by approximately 70%. Furthermore, we illustrate the merits of reducing ligand-protein interactions prior to potential of mean force calculations using the murine double minute homologue protein MDM2 with a p53-derived peptide ligand (PPS-approach). Here, the problem of breaking strong interactions in the binding pocket is transferred to a prior alchemical transformation that reduces the free-energy barrier between the bound and unbound state in the potential of mean force. Besides, disentangling physical ligand displacement from the deinstallation of ligand-protein interactions was seen to allow a more uniform sampling of distance histograms in the umbrella sampling. In the future, physical ligand unbinding combined with simultaneous alchemical modifications may prove useful in the calculation of protein-protein binding free energies, where sampling problems posed by multiple, possibly sticky interactions and potential steric clashes can thus be reduced.",GOF

The bioeffects of LINC0514 in NSCLC cells were examined using cell counting kit-8, colony formation, and transwell assays. Western blotting was used to measure the expression of the target proteins. The LINC00514 regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was assessed using a specific agonist (LiCl) and luciferase reporter assay. We found that LINC00514 expression was elevated in NSCLC cells and clinical samples and that increased LINC00514 expression predicted poorer patient prognosis. Silencing LINC00514 suppresses proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells. Downregulation of LINC00514 inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, suppression of the biological phenotypes of NSCLC cells induced by LINC00514 gene silencing was restored after LiCl treatment.

35653863,"An optical fiber SPR biosensor based on multimode fiber (MMF)- hollow core fiber (HCF)-MMF is proposed and experimentally confirmed for in situ DNA hybridization analysis. In order to improve the sensitivity of DNA hybridization detection, a sandwich model based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) amplification is proposed. In this model, the probe DNA (pDNA) is first modified on the optical fiber sensing area by covalent bonding, and then the biotinylated target DNA (tDNA) is modified on the AuNPs by the high affinity between biotin and streptavidin. Finally, the tDNA on the surface of the AuNPs specifically hybridizes with the pDNA on the optical fiber to form a sandwich model. The near field coupling enhancement between AuNPs and gold film and the high mass ratio of AuNPs give high sensitivity to DNA hybridization detection. Experimental results show that the sandwich-type fiber SPR sensor has a log-linear response in the DNA concentration range of 1 pM-10 nM, and the sensitivity and detection limit are 4.04 nm/log(μM) and 1pM, respectively.

Our Next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis identified an additional set of 25% re-biopsy samples to harbor EGFR T790M mutation occurring at a low-allele frequency of 5% or less, undetectable by conventional qPCR-based assays. Notably, the clinical utility of osimertinib among patients harboring low-allele frequency of EGFR T790M in tissue biopsy upon disease progression remains less explored. We established erlotinib-resistant PC-9R cells and twenty single-cell sub-clones from erlotinib-sensitive lung cancer PC-9 cells using in vitro drug-escalation protocol. NGS and allele-specific PCR confirmed the low-allele frequency of EGFR T790M present at 5% with a 100-fold higher resistance to erlotinib in the PC-9R cells and its sub-clones. Additionally, luciferase tagged PC-9, and PC-9R cells were orthotopically injected through the intercostal muscle into NOD-SCID mice. The orthotopic lung tumors formed were observed by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging. Consistent with in vitro data, osimertinib, but not erlotinib, caused tumor regression in mice injected with PC-9R cells, while both osimertinib and erlotinib inhibited tumors in mice injected with PC-9 cells.

Treatment was done orally for 28 days, thereafter, oxidative stress (SOD, CAT, GSH, and MDA), inflammatory (TNF-α and IL-6) and apoptotic (Bcl-2) markers were assayed using standard biochemical assays as well as histoarchitectural study of the endothelium.
The results showed that they were significant increase in MDA, ET-1, TNF-α and IL-6 while SOD, GSH, CAT, NO and Bcl-2 protein expression were decreased in Lead exposed animals. Endothelial histoarchitecture was also altered. Following Cabbage juice treatment, MDA, ET-I, TNF-α and IL-6 were down-regulated while SOD, GSH, CAT, NO and Bcl-2 protein expression were up-regulated. Histoarchitecture was significantly recovered.

35653982,"Brain metastases (BMs) are frequent events in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and are associated with poor prognosis. Small-molecule anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are promising agents for the treatment of BM. In this study, we assess the clinical outcomes of patients with HER2-positive MBC and BM treated with TKI-containing regimens compared with those treated with non-TKI-containing regimens.
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and conference proceedings (ASCO, SABCS, ESMO, and ESMO Breast) were searched up to June 2021. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with BM. Secondary endpoints included PFS in patients without BM and overall survival (OS). The study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall effects were pooled using random-effects models.
This systematic review and meta-analysis included data from 2437 patients (490 with and 1947 without BM at baseline) enrolled in five trials assessing tucatinib-, lapatinib-, pyrotinib-, or afatinib-based combinations. A nonstatistically significant PFS benefit favoring TKI-containing regimens was observed in both patients with BM [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-1.12; P = 0.13] and without BM (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.24-1.26; P = 0.16). Sensitivity analysis, excluding each study singly, demonstrated a significant PFS benefit favoring TKI-containing regimens in patients with BM after the exclusion of afatinib from the analysis (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90; P = 0.016). No statistically significant differences in OS were observed between the comparison groups.
A trend in PFS favoring TKI-containing regimens was observed in patients with BM. Sensitivity analysis including only trials that evaluated regimens containing tucatinib, lapatinib, or pyrotinib demonstrated a significant PFS benefit favoring TKI-containing regimens in patients with BM.",GOF
35653983,"Up to 40% of patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer develop brain metastases (BMs). Understanding of clinical features of these patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and BMs is vital.
A total of 2948 patients from the Brain Metastases in Breast Cancer registry were available for this analysis, of whom 1311 had primary tumors with the HER2-positive subtype.
Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and BMs were-when compared with HER2-negative patients-slightly younger at the time of breast cancer and BM diagnosis, had a higher pathologic complete response rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a higher tumor grade. Furthermore, extracranial metastases at the time of BM diagnosis were less common in HER2-positive patients, when compared with HER2-negative patients. HER2-positive patients had more often BMs in the posterior fossa, but less commonly leptomeningeal metastases. The median overall survival (OS) in all HER2-positive patients was 13.2 months (95% confidence interval 11.4-14.4). The following factors were associated with shorter OS (multivariate analysis): older age at BM diagnosis [≥60 versus <60 years: hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, P < 0.001], lower Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status (2-4 versus 0-1: HR 1.59, P < 0.001), higher number of BMs (2-3 versus 1: HR 1.30, P = 0.082; ≥4 versus 1: HR 1.51, P = 0.004; global P = 0.015), BMs in the fossa anterior (HR 1.71, P < 0.001), leptomeningeal metastases (HR 1.63, P = 0.012), symptomatic BMs at diagnosis (HR 1.35, P = 0.033) and extracranial metastases at diagnosis of BMs (HR 1.43, P = 0.020). The application of targeted therapy after the BM diagnosis (HR 0.62, P < 0.001) was associated with longer OS. HER2-positive/hormone receptor-positive patients showed longer OS than HER2-positive/hormone receptor-negative patients (median 14.3 versus 10.9 months; HR 0.86, P = 0.03), but no differences in progression-free survival were seen between both groups.
We identified factors associated with the prognosis of HER2-positive patients with BMs. Further research is needed to understand the factors determining the longer survival of HER2-positive/hormone receptor-positive patients.",GOF
35654000,"Although breast MRI is known to be the best imaging modality for assessing the response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), discordance still remains between MRI findings and final pathology findings.
To evaluate imaging and clinicopathologic factors associated with radiologic-pathologic discordance in breast cancer patients after NAC.
This retrospective study included 104 breast cancer patients (mean age: 50.2 years) who underwent breast MRI examinations before and after NAC between June 2015 and December 2019. Radiologic complete response (rCR) was defined as equal or lesser enhancement compared with breast tissue in post-NAC MRI. Pathologic CR (pCR) was defined as absence of invasive cancer in final pathology. Imaging and clinicopathologic factors associated with radiologic-pathologic discordance were analyzed with logistic regression analysis.
Overall rCR and pCR rates were 37.5% (39/107) and 40.2% (43/107), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of non-mass enhancement (odds ratio [OR], 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-11.2; P = 0.03) and multicentric lesions on pre-NAC MRI (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.2-14.9; P = 0.03) were independently associated with radiologic-pathologic discordance. False-positive rate for predicting residual tumor was the most prevalent in HER2-positive cancers (86.7%).
When determining rCR, the presence of non-mass enhancement and multicentric lesions on pre-NAC MRI, and HER2-positive cancers should be interpreted with caution.",GOF

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided, time-limited ibrutinib plus venetoclax treatment in this patient group.
HOVON141/VISION was an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial conducted in 47 hospitals in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with or without TP53 aberrations; had not been exposed to Bruton tyrosine-kinase inhibitors or BCL2 inhibitors; had a creatinine clearance rate of 30 mL/min or more; and required treatment according to International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2018 criteria. Participants with undetectable MRD (<10
Between July 12, 2017, and Jan 21, 2019, 230 patients were enrolled, 225 of whom were eligible. 188 (84%) of 225 completed treatment with ibrutinib plus venetoclax and were tested for MRD at cycle 15. After cycle 15, 78 (35%) patients had undetectable MRD and 72 (32%) were randomly assigned to a treatment group (24 to ibrutinib maintenance and 48 to treatment cessation). The remaining 153 patients were not randomly assigned and continued with ibrutinib monotherapy. Median follow-up of 208 patients still alive and not lost to follow-up at data cutoff on June 22, 2021, was 34·4 months (IQR 30·6-37·9). Progression-free survival after 12 months in the treatment cessation group was 98% (95% CI 89-100). Infections (in 130 [58%] of 225 patients), neutropenia (in 91 [40%] patients), and gastrointestinal adverse events (in 53 [24%] patients) were the most frequently reported; no new safety signals were detected. Serious adverse events were reported in 46 (40%) of 116 patients who were not randomly assigned and who continued ibrutinib maintenance after cycle 15, eight (33%) of 24 patients in the ibrutinib maintenance group, and four (8%) of 48 patients in the treatment cessation group. One patient who was not randomly assigned had a fatal adverse event (bleeding) deemed possibly related to ibrutinib.
These data point to a favourable benefit-risk profile of MRD-guided, time-limited treatment with ibrutinib plus venetoclax for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, suggesting that MRD-guided cessation and reinitiation is feasible in this patient population.

35654143,"Invadopodia on cancer cells play crucial roles in tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading and remodeling the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECM) and driving cell migration in complex three-dimensional environments. Previous studies have indicated that microtubules (MTs) play a crucial role in elongation of invadopodia, but not their formation, probably by regulating delivery of membrane and secretory proteins within invadopodia. However, the identity of the responsible MT-based molecular motors and their regulation has been elusive. Here, we show that KIF1C, a member of kinesin-3 family, is localized to the tips of invadopodia and is required for their elongation and the invasion of cancer cells. We also found that c-Src phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the stalk domain of KIF1C, thereby enhancing its association with tyrosine phosphatase PTPD1, that in turn activates MT-binding ability of KIF1C, probably by relieving the autoinhibitory interaction between its motor and stalk domains. These findings shed new insights into how c-Src signaling is coupled to the MT-dependent dynamic nature of invadopodia, and also advance our understanding of the mechanism of KIF1C activation through release of its autoinhibition.",GOF

This study aimed to establish a rapid, sensitive, and simple method for the direct detection of M. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis in clinical samples without DNA extraction.
We established a duplex recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) assay with the RNAseP gene as an internal control for detecting the P1 gene of M. pneumoniae and the ORF8 gene of C. trachomatis, respectively. The results were obtained at 39 °C within 15-20 min. A total of 130 clinical samples suspected of M. pneumoniae or C. trachomatis infection were collected and tested by duplex RAA and PCR. DNA extracted via a commercial kit or treated with a nucleic acid-releasing agent was used and compared, respectively. Standard recombinant plasmids were used to test the sensitivity of the duplex RAA assay. In addition, other similar common pathogens were used to verify the specificity of the duplex RAA assay.
The sensitivity of the duplex RAA assay for detecting M. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis was 10 copies/μL using recombinant plasmids. Compared with PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of duplex RAA assays for M. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis was 100% using clinical DNA samples extracted using a commercial kit and a nucleic acid-releasing agent, and the Kappa value was 1.

35654242,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain cancer in adult patients. A variety of long non-coding RNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of GBM, however the molecular functions of most of them still remain elusive. Here, we investigated linc-RoR (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of reprogramming) using GBM neurospheres obtained from 12 different patients. We demonstrated that the highest level of this transcript is detected in cells with increased EGFR expression. According to our data, linc-RoR knockdown decreases cell proliferation, increases sensitivity to DNA damage, and downregulates the level of cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. On the other hand, linc-RoR overexpression promote cell growth and increases the proportion of CSCs. Analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed that linc-RoR affects expression of genes involved in the regulation of mitosis. In agreement with this observation, we have showen that the highest level of linc-RoR is detected in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, when linc-RoR is localized on the chromosomes of dividing cells. Based on our results, we can propose that linc-RoR performs pro-oncogenic functions in human gliobalstoma cells, which may be associated with the regulation of mitotic progression and GBM stemness.",GOF

This study aimed to investigate the effects of using cathodal and/or anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in different stages of ischemia-reperfusion on apoptosis and controlling hyperthermia and hyperglycemia.
A total of 78 male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into six groups (n=13), including sham, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS), cathodal-tDCS (c-tDCS), anodal/cathodal-tDCS (a/c-tDCS), and cathodal/anodal-tDCS (c/a-tDCS) groups. Global cerebral I/R was induced in all of the groups except for sham group. In a-tDCS and c-tDCS groups, the rats received anodal and cathodal currents in both I/R stages, respectively. In a/c-tDCS group, the rats received anodal current during the ischemia and cathodal current during the reperfusion. The c/a-tDCS group received the currents in the reverse order. The current intensity of 400µA was applied in ischemia phase (15min) and reperfusion phase (30min, twice a day). Body temperature and plasma blood sugar were measured daily. Rats were also tested for novel object recognition and passive avoidance memory. The apoptosis of hippocampal tissue was evaluated by measuring Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and TUNEL staining.
All tDCS significantly reduced hyperthermia and hyperglycemia, as well as Bax and Caspase-3 levels, it also increased Bcl-2 expression. The preliminary results from c/a-tDCS mode could improve the expression of apoptotic markers, memory function, hyperthermia, and hyperglycemia control and reduce DNA fragmentation compared to other stimulatory therapies.
All tDCS modes could save neurons by suppressing apoptotic and enhancing anti-apoptotic pathways, especially in the c/a tDCS mode.",GOF
35654294,"Social interactions play an important role in our daily lives and can profoundly impact our health for better and worse. To better understand the neural circuitry underlying social behavior, we focused on neural circuits involving vasopressin neurons of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and serotonin neurons of the dorsal raphe (DR). Previous research shows that BNST vasopressin neurons are activated in male mice by interaction with a female and that vasopressin indirectly excites serotonin neurons. In our studies, we tested the hypothesis that specific social interactions would also activate neurons in the DR, specifically vasopressin 1A receptor (Avpr1a)-expressing neurons, which may be direct targets of the BNST vasopressin neurons. Using in separate experiments immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we found that male and female subjects exposed to a female conspecific show activation in the DR, and the activated neurons include populations of Avpr1a-expressing and other non-serotonergic, non-Avpr1a neurons in roughly equal numbers. Avpr1a neurons in the DR constitute a largely undocumented neuron population. Electrophysiological data suggest that most DR Avpr1a neurons behave like fast spiking interneurons found in other brain regions. Examination of RNAseq and in situ hybridization data suggests that there are glutamatergic, GABAergic, and serotonergic subtypes of Avpr1a neurons in the DR. Together our data support a model in which a subset of vasopressin-responsive interneurons in the DR may relay stimulus specific social signals from the forebrain BNST to the serotonergic DR system, which could help direct prosocial stimulus specific behavioral responses.",GOF

The purpose of this study is to evaluate metastatic disease burden and the incidence of oligometastatic disease using recent clinical trial edibility criteria.
A cohort of patients with metastatic NSCLC, diagnosed from 2016 to 2019, were randomly sampled from a curated tumor registry. Definitions for oligometastatic disease were obtained from relevant clinical trials. The Stanford Cancer Institute Research Database (SCIRDB) was used to identify baseline patient factors, systemic and local therapy, extent and location of metastatic lesions, and survival outcomes.
Among 120 patients presenting with metastatic NSCLC, the majority had de novo metastatic disease (75%) with a median of 4 metastatic lesions involving 3 organ systems. 37.5% would have been eligible for at least one oligometastatic trial with 28.3% meeting criteria for MDACC, 20.0% for NRG-LU002, 6.7% for SINDAS and 16.7% for SABR-COMET. By adding malignant pleural effusions (MPE) and early progression as exclusionary criteria, only 54.1% of patients with ≤3 synchronous metastases were eligible for consideration of local therapy. Early progression on systemic therapy was associated with worse survival (10.0 vs. 42.4 months, p < 0.001), whereas presence of MPE was not. Of those tumors identified as oligometastatic, 44.4% received local therapy and 28.9% underwent ablative therapy to all sites. There was a trend towards greater overall survival (44.4 vs 24.9 months, p=0.055) and progression free survival (8.0 vs. 5.4 months, p=0.06) in patients meeting eligibility for at least one oligometastatic trial.

An Indigenous American breast cancer protective germline variant (rs140068132) has been reported near the Estrogen Receptor 1 gene. This study tests the association of rs140068132 and other polymorphisms in the 6q25 region with subtype-specific breast cancer risk in Hispanic/Latinas of high Indigenous American ancestry.
Genotypes were obtained for 5,094 Peruvian women with (1,755) and without (3,337) breast cancer. Associations between genotype and overall and subtype-specific risk for the protective variant were tested using logistic regression models and conditional analyses including other risk-associated polymorphisms in the region.
We replicated the reported association between rs140068132 and breast cancer risk overall (odds ratio (OR)=0.53, 95%CI=0.47-0.59), as well as the lower odds of developing hormone receptor negative (HR-) vs. HR+ disease (OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.61-0.97). Models including Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) showed further heterogeneity with reduced odds for HR+HER2+ (OR=0.68, 95%CI=0.51-0.92), HR-HER2+ (OR=0.63, 95%CI 0.44-0.90) and HR-HER2- (OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.56-1.05) compared to HR+HER2-. Inclusion of other risk-associated variants did not change these observations.
The rs140068132 polymorphism is associated with decreased risk of breast cancer in Peruvians and is more protective against HR- and HER2+ diseases independently of other breast cancer-associated variants in the 6q25 region.
These results could inform functional analyses to understand the mechanism by which rs140068132-G reduces risk of breast cancer development in a subtype-specific manner. They also illustrate the importance of including diverse individuals in genetic studies.",GOF

Discerning ACE/CH from germline variants and post-zygotic mosaicism (PZM) is critically needed for risk assessment and management.
Participants in the Li Fraumeni & TP53 Understanding & Progress (LiFT UP) study with a TP53 PV were eligible. Demographics, personal/family cancer history and clinical laboratory test reports were obtained. DNA from multiple tissues was analyzed using a custom QIAseq® assay (ACE panel) that included TP53 and other CH-associated genes; the ACE panel and eyebrow follicles were assessed in a workflow to discern TP53 PV clinical categories.
Among 134 participants there was a significant difference for the age at diagnosis (p=<0.001), component cancers (p=0.007), and clinical testing criteria (p=<0.001), comparing germline vs PZM or ACE. ACE panel analysis of DNA from 55 sets of eyebrow follicles (mean 1.4 ug) and 36 formalin-fixed paraffin imbedded tissues demonstrated low variance (standard error 3%; p = 0.993) for TP53 variant allele fraction, with no significant difference (p=0.965) between tissue types, and detected CH gene PVs. Of 55 multi-tissue cases, germline status was confirmed for 20, PZM in 7, ACE for 25 and 3 were indeterminate. Additional CH variants were detected in 6 ACE and 2 germline cases.

We compared results to those for European, Asian and African-American ancestry women.
The frequency of PV in GBHS for nine breast cancer genes was 8.38% in cases and 1.22% in controls. Relative risk estimates for overall breast cancer were: OR (95% CI)=13.70 (4.03-46.51) for BRCA1, 7.02 (3.17-15.54) for BRCA2, 17.25 (2.15-138.13) for PALB2, 5/0 cases/controls for TP53, and 2.10, (0.72-6.14) for moderate-risk genes combined (ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD52D). These estimates were similar to those previously reported in other populations and were modified by ER status. No other genes evaluated had mutations associated at P<0.05 with overall risk. The estimated lifetime risks for mutation carriers in BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2 and moderate risk genes were 18.4%, 9.8%, 22.4% and 3.1%, respectively, markedly lower than in Western populations with higher baseline risks.
We confirmed associations between PV and breast cancer risk in Ghanaian women and provide absolute risk estimates that could inform counseling in Ghana and other West African countries.

35654473,"Healthy tissue hotspots are a main limiting factor in administering deep hyperthermia cancer therapy. We propose an optimization scheme that uses time-multiplexed steering (TMPS) among minimally correlated (nearly) Pareto-optimal solutions to suppress hotspots without reducing tumor heating. Furthermore, tumor heating homogeneity is maximized, thus reducing toxicity and avoiding underexposed tumor regions, which in turn may reduce recurrence.
The novel optimization scheme combines random generation of steering parameters with local optimization to efficiently identify the set of (Pareto-) optimal solutions of conflicting optimization goals. To achieve simultaneous suppression of hotspots, multiple steering parameter configurations with minimally correlated hotspots are selected near the Pareto front and combined in TMPS. The performance of the novel scheme was compared with that of a multi-goal Genetic Algorithm for a range of simulated treatment configurations involving a modular applicator heating a generic tumor situated in the bladder, cervix, or pelvic bone. SAR cumulative histograms in tumor and healthy tissue, as well as hotspot volumes are used as metrics.
Compared to the non-TMPS optimization, the proposed scheme was able to reduce the peak temperature in healthy tissue by 0.2 °C-1.0 °C (a thermal dose reduction by at least 26%) and, importantly, the hotspot volume above 42 °C in healthy tissue by 41%-86%. At the same time, tumor heating homogeneity was maintained or improved.

The molecular mechanisms of paraspeckle formation have been mainly studied using human or mouse cells, and it is not known if the same molecular components are involved in the formation of paraspeckles in other mammalian species. We thus investigated the expression pattern of NEAT1_2 in naked mole-rats (nNEAT1_2), which exhibit extreme longevity and lower susceptibility to cancer. In the intestine, nNEAT1_2 is widely expressed along the entire intestinal epithelium, which is different from the expression of mNeat1_2, that is restricted to the cells of the distal tip in mice. Notably, the expression of FUS, a FET family RNA binding protein, essential for the formation of paraspeckles both in humans and mice, was absent in the distal part of the intestinal epithelium in naked mole-rats. Instead, mRNAs of other FET family proteins EWSR1 and TAF15 were expressed in the distal region. Exogenous expression of these proteins in Fus-deficient murine embryonic fibroblast cells rescued the formation of paraspeckles. These observations suggest that nNEAT1_2 recruits different set of RNA binding proteins in a cell type-specific manner during the formation of paraspeckles in different organisms.",GOF
35654539,"The Elegies of Maximianus Etruscus (sixth century CE) are first-person narratives in which the poet writes about the life cycle, making love and sex the building blocks of the story. Through his failed relationships with different women, Maximianus talks about the perception of his aging, especially the changes in his body and his eroticism, and the progressive loss of masculinity that to him comes with old age. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between old age and gender in Maximianus' elegies from a double perspective: the perception of old age itself as a unique and personal fact, and age and masculinity as interacting social constructions that are historically constructed. We will address issues such as the emotions linked to aging, the representation of old age as a living death, the relationship of masculinity with sexuality and the importance of erection. Finally, we will place Maximianus' poems within their historical context, analyzing how they can be interpreted as a metaphor for the period in which its author lived, in which old age and loss of power symbolized the disappearance of the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy and, in general, the end of the Roman Empire. A literary exercise but also a life story, this set of six elegies allows us to approach the social construction of gender and age in Late Antiquity.",GOF

The predictive RF model was confirmed to be the best, with a satisfactory stability and prediction capacity (area under the curve=0.889).
Six metabolites as potential predictors for distinguishing between cerebral thrombi of CE and LAA origin were identified. The results are useful for understanding the pathogenesis and for secondary stroke prevention.",GOF

Our objective was to reveal potential function of FSIP2 in regulating sperm acrosome formation.
We performed whole exome sequencing on four asthenoteratozoospermic patients. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to assess the protein expression of FSIP2. Proteomics approach, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation were implemented to clarify the molecules in acrosome biogenesis regulated by FSIP2.

35654584,"The Gold Coast criteria (GCC) have been proposed as a means of selecting patients for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical trials. We aimed to characterise disease progression according to the GCC.
Data from population-based ALS registries from the Netherlands and Belgium were analysed. The GCC additionally define ALS as lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction in ≥2 body regions without upper motor neuron dysfunction. Therefore, the revised El Escorial criteria (rEEC) were supplemented with a 'Gold Coast ALS' category for patients with only LMN dysfunction in ≥2 body regions. We assessed survival time, ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) progression rates and between-patient variability per diagnostic category.
We included 5957 ALS patients, of whom 600 (10.1%) fulfilled the GCC but not the rEEC, and 95 (1.6%) fulfilled only the rEEC. ALSFRS-R progression rates were similar for the rEEC (0.84 points/month) and GCC (0.81 points/month) with similar variability (standard deviation of 0.59 vs. 0.60) and median survival time (17.8 vs.18.7 months). Survival time and average progression rates varied (p<0.001) between categories. Per category, however, there was considerable between-patient variability with progression rates ranging from: -2.10 to -0.14 (definite), -1.94 to -0.06 (probable), -2.10 to -0.02 (probable laboratory supported), -1.79 to -0.02 (possible) and -1.31 to 0.08 (Gold Coast).
The GCC broaden the definition of ALS, allowing more patients to participate in trials, while minimally impacting population heterogeneity. Given the large variability per diagnostic category, selecting only specific categories for trials may not result in a more homogeneous study population.",GOF
35654585,"To evaluate prescription trends and clinical factors of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) use according to the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heart failure (HF) in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Prescription patterns of SGLT2i use between 2015 and 2019 were determined using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database of claims.
Of all patients with T2DM (n=4,736,493), the annual prescription rate of SGLT2i increased every year in patients with ASCVD (from 2.2% to 10.7%) or HF (from 2.0% to 11.1%). After the first hospitalization for ASCVD (n=518,572), 13.7% (n=71,259) of patients initiated SGLT2i with a median of 10.6 months. After hospitalization for HF (n=372,853), 11.2% (n=41,717) of patients initiated SGLT2i after a median of 8.8 months. In multivariate regression for hospitalization, older age (per 10 years, odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.57), lower household income (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.95), rural residents (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.97), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) users (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.84) were associated with lesser initiation of SGLT2i in ASCVD. Additionally, female gender (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.99) was associated with lesser initiation of SGLT2i in HF.
The prescription rate of SGLT2i increased gradually up to 2019 but was suboptimal in patients with ASCVD or HF. After the first hospitalization for ASCVD or HF, older age, female gender, low household income, rural residents, and DPP-4i users were less likely to initiate SGLT2i.",GOF
